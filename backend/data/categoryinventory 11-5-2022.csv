Don't worry, there are still plenty of horror movies for us to steal names from - so stay tuned!"

Auto-Borne Colors are waterborne meaning the colors contain solvent for exceptional performance. Auto- 
Borne have virtually no tip-dry, superior control able pull long & continuous lines without skipping or grainy 
over-spray, work with all airbrush tip-sizes and dry incredibly fast. Auto-Borne Colors are lightfast and 
durable. Pigments are highly-refined and lightfast for superior atomization without fading. All Auto-Borne 
Color pigments are exterior-grade with a 7 to 8 out of 8 on a Blue Wool Scale (BWS). <br>
• Auto-Borne is compatible with other Auto Air Colors and may be inter-coated in any manner. Direct inter- 
mixing is not recommended. <br>
• Auto-Borne is reduced with 4011 Flash Reducer. Recommended reduction for use with spray-guns is 
approximately 10% per volume. For airbrush use, reduce 3:1 or greater depending upon tip-size and 
preference. Operating PSI varies per gun. Spray gun PSI is recommended @ 35 with a 1.2mm tip-size. <br>
• Top-coat with a catalyzed, urethane clear. Other types of clear may also be used; test first. <br>
• Auto-Borne Colors are semi-opaque but may be reduced down to a transparent color which is better 
suited for detailed, fine-line airbrushing with small tip-sized airbrushes. <br>
• Auto-Borne follows preparation and application processes the same as other Auto Air Colors. For further 
information, refer to Auto Air Application Guide."
