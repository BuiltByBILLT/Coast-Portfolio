The element is made of special resin with large meshes which is effective in removing water. Air containing water flows into the inside of the element and then through it.  Water drops grow by colliding with each other.  As the drops collect on the element fibers, they are pushed to the outside and pool in the bowl.  The bowl can be discharged by opening the drain cock. With this method, 99% of the water can be removed to obtain air containing almost no water. </br>",""

</p>
<p>
<p>

<font color=""white"">Loose Leaf:<br></font>
The leaves are placed in paper booklets, loosely inlaid in 25 compartments, one for each leaf. To cut the leaf, one may take it from the booklet with the gilding knife and place it on the gilding cushion or drop it directly from the booklet onto the gilding cushion. Then, pick up the leaf with the gilder’s tip and place it onto the prepared surface.
<p>
<font color=""white"">Transfer (Patent) Leaf:<br></font>
The individual gold leaves are pressed onto a tissue paper. One uses patent gold, also called tempest gold, when gilding outdoors. The tissue paper is larger than the gold leaf, thus it may be more easily handled. It is also possible to cut the patent leaves into desired shapes/forms with scissors. The leaves are placed onto the prepared surface and carefully rubbed with cotton wool. The tissue paper may then be removed as the gold leaf will adhere to the surface/object.<p>

The element is made of special resin with large meshes which is effective in removing water.

Air containing water flows into the inside of the element and then through it.  Water drops grow by colliding with each other.  As the drops collect on the element fibers, they are pushed to the outside and pool in the bowl.  The bowl can be discharged by opening the drain cock.

With this method, 99% of the water can be removed to obtain air containing almost no water. </br>",""

Replaceable atomizing heads afford the performance of a new gun, on demand and at a fraction of the cost.</p>
            <p><strong>ONE System for Every Spraying Need</strong><br>
              The 3M™ Accuspray™ ONE Spray Gun System with PPS™ Series 2.0 is the combination of convenience, versatility and efficiency. This system features the Accuspray™ ONE Spray Gun - a lightweight, composite spray gun body designed to eliminate the complexity of a traditional spray gun. This gun body has been engineered for enhanced durability in automotive and industrial environments. The spray gun uses a series of replaceable, see-through atomizing heads which can be reused 5-10 times and then simply removed and replaced. This affords the performance of a brand new spray gun, on demand and at a fraction of the price.</p>
            <p><strong>Replaceable Atomizing Heads for the 3M™ Accuspray™ ONE Spray Gun System with PPS™ Series 2.0</strong><br>
              Our 3M™ Accuspray™ Atomizing Heads for PPS™ Series 2.0 deliver the ideal atomization to a wide range of fluids and coatings applied with Accuspray™ ONE Spray Guns. Atomizing heads are available in five sizes: 2.0 mm (red), 1.8 mm (clear), 1.4 mm (orange), 1.3 mm (green) and 1.2 mm (blue). For sealers, basecoats and topcoats, we recommend 1.3 mm or 1.4 mm atomizing heads. Choose the 1.8 mm size for higher-viscosity materials such as primer, and the 2.0 mm size for heavy-duty applications using fluids like gel coats, adhesives, undercoats or industrial coatings. Always refer to your paint company&rsquo;s recommendations. Fast, easy controls for fan diameter, fluid and air pressure on the Accuspray™ ONE gun allow for quick adjustment across jobs from spot repairs to full panel coverage requiring up to 12&rdquo; vertical or horizontal spray patterns<br>
            </p>
            <p>Along with the distinctive color, the fluid tip size is presented clearly on each atomizing head for fast, accurate selection. Atomizing heads are see-through to make it easy for technicians to determine that the head is properly cleaned.<br>
            </p>
            <p>All atomizing heads work with our PPS™ Series 2.0 Spray Cup System – a system of reusable paint cups and disposable lids and liners, so you can be done with cleaning paint cups forever. ONE gun – ONE system for a complete range of applications.</p>

        <p><strong>ONE System for Every Spraying Need</strong></p>
        <p>An all-in-one solution for mixing/measuring, filtering and spraying of  primer, sealer, base and clear coat, our 3M™ Accuspray™ Spray Gun System  with Standard PPS™ is a combination of convenience, versatility and  efficiency. This system features the Accuspray™ ONE Spray Gun - a lightweight, composite spray gun body that is molded in one piece,  eliminating the complexity, wear and cleaning of small parts and pieces. The spray gun uses a series of replaceable, transparent atomizing heads  which can be reused 5-10 times and then simply removed and replaced.  This affords the performance of a brand new spray gun, on demand and at a fraction of the price. Atomizing heads are available in 1.3 mm and 1.4 mm sizes for sealers, primer surfacers, basecoats and topcoats; a 1.8 mm size for  higher-viscosity materials such as primer and gel coats; and a 2.0 mm size for heavy-duty applications using fluids like adhesives, undercoats or industrial coatings. Utilizes 10 CFM @ 20PSI. Fast, easy controls for fan diameter, fluid  and air pressure allow for quick adjustment across jobs from spot repairs to full panel coverage requiring up to 12"" vertical or  horizontal spray patterns. This equipment works with our Standard PPS™  system of reusable paint cups and disposable lids and liners, so you can  be done with cleaning paint cups forever. ONE gun — ONE system for a  complete range of applications. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Advantages of the 3M™ PPS™ System</strong> <br>
          Unlike conventional paint cup systems, our <a href=""http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/800627O/3mtm-ppstm-midi-brochure.pdf"" target=""_blank"">3M™ PPS™</a>  eliminates the need for mixing paint in additional  paint mix cups and then transferring the paint through a separate filter  into a paint reservoir. This is an important advantage because waste  occurs every time that a user transfers paint through mixing cups and  filters. With PPS™, you place the disposable liner within the re-usable  PPS™ Cup. Then simply mix the paint in the PPS™ disposable liner, snap  the disposable lid (with the pre-welded filter) in place and attach the  locking collar to complete the PPS™ System. With just these few simple  steps, you're ready to start spraying. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Your Spray Gun Functions at any Angle, Even Upside Down</strong> <br>
          PPS™ allows the painter to spray consistently 90° to the part, no  matter how the part is positioned. This makes material transfer more  consistent, limits paint overspray and lowers paint consumption. Because  PPS is a closed system, you can operate in any orientation -  i.e. 360  degrees.        </p>
        <strong>Clean Up is a Breeze and Uses Less Solvent</strong> <br>
        After spraying, the painter can use a sealing plug to seal and protect  paint materials or simply discard disposable lid and liner, leaving only  the adapter and spray gun to clean. Discard the disposable lid and  liner in the appropriate approved waste containers specified by the  paint manufacturer (or local government requirements). Use a small  amount of solvent for cleaning the spray gun and the <a href=""http://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-PPS-Adapter?N=5002385+8709313+8709375+8711017+8711441+8711727+8716717+8719367+3293219713&rt=rud"" target=""_self"">PPS™ adapter</a>.  With this disposable paint system, shops are often experiencing a 70%  reduction in cleaning solvents, which means solvent cleaning savings and  solvent disposal savings. Most guns can be cleaned with less than 3 oz.  of solvent. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>A Versatile System that Works with Most Spray Guns</strong> <br>
        Specifically designed PPS™ stainless steel metal adapters allow painters to use the PPS™ system with virtually any spray gun. Painters have also the option to use the <a href=""http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1226430O/160305165-accuspray-one-spray-gun-flyer.pdf"" target=""_blank"">3M™ Accuspray™ ONE spray gun</a> (PDF, 3.69 Mb), which requires no adapters. Technicians have found that  this spray gun further reduces cleaning solvent usage and cleaning and  maintenance time. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Reduces the Chance of Contamination Between Jobs</strong> <br>
        Because the painter uses a new disposable lid (with welded-in filter)  and disposable liner for each mix, there is less risk of outside  contamination due to mixing, filtering, and clean up. Using a fresh lid  and liner with each paint job, rather than washing out reusable  components, often improves overall productivity in prep and clean-up  time by as much as 15%. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The Bottom Line: Why 3M™ PPS™ is the Paint &amp; Coatings Spray System of Choice</strong> <br>
        3M™ PPS™ is an all-in-one disposable painting system that produces  cleaner jobs, saves on paint consumption and reduces solvent usage by up  to 70%. You'll find that technicians operate with greater efficiency  and spend less time on cleaning tasks. 3M PPS offers many advantages for  any one spraying liquid coatings from a spray gun with cup. </div>

      <p><strong>More Wet Time, Less Sling</strong> <br>
      You never thought one machine polish could deliver both of these important advantages during final paint finishing — until now. Our 3M™ Perfect-It™ EX Ultrafine Machine Polish stays wet longer on the substrate, meaning you don't need to keep reapplying it and using valuable product during the process of machine polishing and swirl removal. This can be especially important in places where heat and humidity are common inside or outside of the shop. Yet the polish also holds better on the pad, reducing the mess, waste and cleanup time associated with sling. Quite simply, our Perfect-It™ EX Ultrafine Machine Polish (PDF, 721 Kb) is our highest-performing machine polish for better material cost efficiency, lower process times and refined, swirl-free final paint finishes.</p>
      <p><strong>An Excellent Finish, Fast</strong> <br>
        As the final step of a truly professional vehicle paint finish, our Perfect-It™ EX Ultrafine Machine Polish quickly and completely removes ultrafine machine polish swirls even on the most difficult black or dark-colored vehicles. At its heart is aluminum oxide, the same mineral used in many of our top-performing abrasive discs and sheets. In fact, fine grade aluminum oxide discs are part of the Scratch Refinement stage of our Perfect-It™ Paint Finishing System, which includes our EX Machine Polishes. This abrasive cuts quickly and uniformly in a very fine grade to remove ultrafine swirl marks left during the machine polishing process.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Part of the 3M™ Perfect-It™ Paint Finishing System</strong> <br>
        3M™ Perfect-It™ EX Ultrafine Machine Polish is integral to our 3M™ Perfect-it™ Paint Finishing System (PDF, 2.6 Mb). Developed to keep pace with evolving paint and clear coat technologies, the Perfect-it™ Paint Finishing System is ideal when the finest finish is required for every level of clear coat and paint repair. This system uses a progressive series of abrasives, buffing and compounding pads, and specially formulated polishes across four stages of repair to produce showroom grade finishes with deep color and rich gloss.<br>
        <br>
        For the best swirl-free finish on all colors, we recommend using Perfect-It™ EX Ultrafine Machine Polish with a blue Perfect-It™ Quick Connect Ultrafine Polishing Pad, PN05708 or PN33286.<br>

    <h3>Product Description</h3>
    <div>
      <div> PPS™ is a complete painting system from 3M™ which produces cleaner  jobs, saves on solvent usage and gun cleaning time and can improve  operator efficiency by as much as 15%. Specifically designed adapters  allow painters to use the PPS™ system with virtually any spray gun. <br>
        <br>
        PPS™  replaces traditional mixing cups and filters and drastically reduces  the amount of solvent required for gun cleaning.  The liner, lid and  built-in filter are all disposable, leaving only the adapter and spray  gun to be cleaned.  It is possible to clean your paint gun with as  little as 3 ounces of solvent.  With these disposable parts, shops can  see a 70% savings in cleaning solvent use -- meaning less operator  exposure to solvents and reduction in VOCs. <br>
        <br>
        Since PPS™ uses  the same cup for mixing and spraying, there less risk of outside  contamination, less time spend mixing and cleaning. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>With PPS™ your spray gun functions at any angle</strong><br>
        Many  painters mix more paint than they need to reduce the chance of starving  the gun.  PPS™ allows painters to spray at any angle without starving  the paint gun. <br>
        <br>

    <h3>Product Description</h3>
    <div>
      <div> PPS™ is a complete painting system from 3M™ which produces cleaner  jobs, saves on solvent usage and gun cleaning time and can improve  operator efficiency by as much as 15%. Specifically designed adapters  allow painters to use the PPS™ system with virtually any spray gun. <br>
        <br>
        PPS™  replaces traditional mixing cups and filters and drastically reduces  the amount of solvent required for gun cleaning.  The liner, lid and  built-in filter are all disposable, leaving only the adapter and spray  gun to be cleaned.  It is possible to clean your paint gun with as  little as 3 ounces of solvent.  With these disposable parts, shops can  see a 70% savings in cleaning solvent use -- meaning less operator  exposure to solvents and reduction in VOCs. <br>
        <br>
        Since PPS™ uses  the same cup for mixing and spraying, there less risk of outside  contamination, less time spend mixing and cleaning. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>With PPS™ your spray gun functions at any angle</strong><br>
        Many  painters mix more paint than they need to reduce the chance of starving  the gun.  PPS™ allows painters to spray at any angle without starving  the paint gun. <br>

    <h3>Product Description</h3>
    <div>
      <div> PPS™ is a complete painting system from 3M™ which produces cleaner  jobs, saves on solvent usage and gun cleaning time and can improve  operator efficiency by as much as 15%. Specifically designed adapters  allow painters to use the PPS™ system with virtually any spray gun. <br>
        <br>
        PPS™  replaces traditional mixing cups and filters and drastically reduces  the amount of solvent required for gun cleaning.  The liner, lid and  built-in filter are all disposable, leaving only the adapter and spray  gun to be cleaned.  It is possible to clean your paint gun with as  little as 3 ounces of solvent.  With these disposable parts, shops can  see a 70% savings in cleaning solvent use -- meaning less operator  exposure to solvents and reduction in VOCs. <br>
        <br>
        Since PPS™ uses  the same cup for mixing and spraying, there less risk of outside  contamination, less time spend mixing and cleaning. <br>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Designed for fine line and critical paint masking, our 3M™ Precision Poly Tape is an ultra-conformable tape with an extremely versatile backing.  </p>
  <p>The UV resistant and waterproof polyethylene film provides clean, one-piece removal indoors or out for up to 7-days. Engineered indicator lines let you know if the tape is being pushed to its limits while the quick snap, straight tear lessens prep time and eliminates the use of razor blades and other tools. Delivering sharp paint lines and our most reliable adhesion, Precision Poly Tape helps you get it done right the first time.</p>
  <h3>A Size for Any Task</h3
  <p>From general masking, fine line masking and jamb masking to buffing, wet sanding and headlight restoration, poly tape comes in a size that will get the job done.</p
  </p>
	  <p><h3>Inside the Technology</h3></p>
	  <em>3M invented masking tape for painting nearly a century ago, and paper-backed tape has been the industry standard ever since. Now, after years of rigorous testing and development, our scientists have capitalized on advances in microreplication technology to create a tape made from stretchable, conformable polyethylene material.</em>
  <p dir=""ltr""><em>Where paper tape can be fussy and finicky, requiring frequent overtaping for proper coverage and prompt removal to avoid tape problems, Precision Poly Tape is different. With its advanced polymeric material and unique adhesive properties, it applies more smoothly, conforms more precisely and releases more cleanly – so you can be more flexible, versatile, accurate and efficient in your painting process. When you get one pass, 3M™ Precision Poly Tape helps you stick it right the first time.</em></p></td>

Uses 3M™'s Hookit™ attachment system.<br>50 Per Box<br><br>","Product Description<br><br>
What the power of 3M™ Purple Clean Sanding Discs can do for you:<br>
•Extend disc life - More power to go the distance with discs that can last 2-3 times longer than traditional no-hole, 5-hole or 6-hole discs.<br><br>
•Increase productivity - Longer-lasting discs improve productivity and the unique multi-hole disc pattern is designed for quicker changes because hole alignment is not required. You'll see the difference in material consumption - and your bottom line.<br><br>
•Clear out more dust with less disc loading - The spiral-patterned disc design features hundreds of holes to give dust a better escape route, moving more dust away from your finishing surface without loading the disc. Dust settles into the loops of the disc, and not in the air or on the disc surface.<br><br>
•Improve cutting ability - Premium abrasives deliver consistent performance to get the job done ... and done right.<br><br>
•Simplify disc application - Discs utilize the 3M™ Hookit™ Attachment System for easy reuse.<br><br>
These discs feature a precise hole design for improved life and dust extraction. They can be used for final sanding of plastic filler and putty.<br><br>

The Iwata HP-C allowed artists who airbrushed the ability to paint with acrylics which gave them the versatility they needed because they could work with both opaque and transparent colors. Using the HP-C with acrylics completely changed airbrush technique for these 3 hugely popular, trailblazing artists in the airbrush industry.<br><br>
Because of these 3 artists’ influence in the airbrush industry, the Iwata HP-C became the main airbrush in all illustration artists’ arsenals. It was the go-to airbrush to create all the advertising & fine art graphics before the advent of computers.
Now you can own a piece of Airbrush History – the Original Iwata HP-C!<br><br>

Only 600 hundred of these being sold in the US! Each airbrush has the 50th ANNIVERSARY insignia and is numbered 1-1000. ONCE THESE ARE GONE, THEY ARE GONE!

        <h2>REFINED ILLUSTRATION DETAIL</h2>
        <p>Illustration Colors offer true fine-line, detailed performance while allowing for re-wettable effects and subtle erasing techniques. As the name implies, Illustration Colors are designed with the illustrator and fine artist  in mind without catering to the demand for high coverage base colors.<br>

          Illustration Colors are lightfast. We use the same exterior-grade  pigments we use to make our Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors. The  difference is in the resin. Unlike Wicked Colors and Auto AirColors which air dry to a cured, non-soluble coating, Illustration Colors are  re-wettable with an amine such as Windex™. This is one of the key characteristics behind the creation of our Illustration Colors. Another key characteristic this resin offers is subtle erasing. Illustration Colors are very easy to erase compared to our resilient Wicked Colors.<br>

Her straightforward, clearly illustrated directions show you how to airbrush everything from backgrounds and murals to animal subjects and delicate human features on virtually any surface. Designing, drawing, painting from photographs; portraying natural and manmade landscapes; manipulating light and dark; painting airplanes, cars, and trucks; depicting birds and reptiles, animals and people in stylized and realistic ways: These are among the many techniques Bortles explains in direct, easy-to-follow terms. Her book is an ideal guide for airbrush painters seeking to expand their skills, and for readers of Bortles earlier book who are hungry for more.",""

Author Doug Mitchel and the artists in the book introduce the reader to a wide range of airbrushing categories, including: fine art/illustration, T-shirts, automotive, fingernails, body and face painting, hip hop and model painting. Each photo sequence with captions is designed to teach beginning airbrush enthusiasts how to pick the best type of paint, mix it for use in the airbrush, adjust the brush itself and apply the paint to the panel, T-shirt, model car or child's face. Doug uses interviews to explore the way in which each artist learned his or her skills, what type of paint they prefer, how they adjust their airbrush, and how to avoid the typical beginner's mistakes. Like any other art form, skillful use of the airbrush is based on a series of simple strokes. Airbrushing 101 includes examples of the basic airbrush strokes and how each is achieved through the careful use of the airbrush trigger and precise hand movement.

<font size=""4"">LV:<br></font>
The LPH400-LV HVLP Spray Guns have set-ups suited for Basecoats and Clearcoats, Waterbornes and other Light to High Viscosity Coatings. Their ""LV Technology"" allows for the best coating performance and the best “real world” transfer efficiency.The Tulip fan pattern greatly improves transfer efficiency and wetness of the pattern all the way through. Overspray rolls with the fan to the surface not to the side or away. Lower atomizing pressure reduces overspray and bounce-back.

<br><br>

<font size=""4"">LVX:<br></font>
Teaming up with our LPH400 LVB the LPH400 LVX eXtreme basecoat technology was developed for use with 90-95% of basecoat colors and engineered to provide increased productivity in application for solvent or waterborne basecoats. While the LPH400 LVB remains the set-up for the most difficult or complex colors the LPH400 LVX handles all the middle range colors where productivity and speed is a must. Extensive field-testing and painter evaluation reports prove that the LPH400 LVX is much faster than the competition and has an ultra smooth application with no technique change. Inlet pressures, spray distance and overlap are the same for the LPH400 LVX as a normal LPH400 LV.<br><br>

<font size=""4"">LVB:<br></font>
The LPH400-LVB high performance center post gravity feed HVLP spray gun is designed for obtaining improved control on refinish paints that contain fine metallic and pearls that standard set-ups face difficulties such as mottling, blotching, streaking, floating, etc. <br><br>

Performance<br><br>

The SUPERNOVA delivers a consistent droplet size when atomizing. This combined with the flat even SUPERNOVA pattern helps reduce common application issues. All SUPERNOVA guns are equipped with stainless steel fluid passages ideal for any type of material, solvent borne or waterborne.<br><br>

Perfect Balance<br><br>

The SUPERNOVA cup angle design guarantees perfect balance regardless of what cup size you choose.<br><br>

Quick Release Air-Cap<br><br>

The larger thread pattern of the air-cap make it both robust and easy to remove and is designed with low maintenance in mind. The new larger grip points on the outside of the air cap ring facilitate quick removal and refitting after cleaning.
<br><br>
Responsive Trigger
<br><br>
The responsive trigger action gives the painter stable air flow control during application. Accurate air pressure an now be set with either the air stroke or the fluid stroke.
<br><br>
Ergonomic Grip
<br><br>
An in-depth study by the University of Pavia into perfect balance and optimal ergonomics was closely considered by PINNFARINA designers and ANEST IWATA engineers to produce this state of the art spray gun. The slim ergonomic grip of the SUPERNOVA spray gun helps distribute weight and balance through the wrist, reducing the risk of repetitive strains.</font><font color=""AB0000""><br><br>*Due to high demand, please allow up to 3 weeks for availability</font><br><br>"

<font color=""white"">Kustom painting takes pole position with the new Iwata Kustom airbrush series that sports large cups and shines in atomizing solvent-based paints. Solvent Proof packing, large cups, pre-set handles and taller triggers distinguish these airbrushes as Kustom.
<br><br>
The first airbrush to create a fan-patterned spray, the TH stands alone among its peers. Triggering the imagination of auto-body touch-up and Kustom painting, the Kustom TH delivers unprecedented control of a fan pattern with a minimum of overspray giving it a unique advantage over mini touch up guns. Great for small areas such as chip repair, fender welds, door jams and other hard-to-reach areas.<p>

The mac daddy of all airbrushes, the Kustom CM is framed around the Iwata Custom Micron airbrush. The Kustom Micron airbrush provides extreme control of ultra fine-line spray, silky smooth atomization and ultimate paint-flow control with hand-tuned, hand-adjusted performance. <br><br>

· A breakthrough technology, the Micro Air Control (MAC) Valve enables infinite control of the airflow at the head of the airbrush, which provides even more control of stippling, fine details and finely atomized background spraying<br><br>

· The solvent-proof needle packing allows for the use of automotive or other solvent-based paints<br><br>

· The Larger 1/2oz funnel shape of the redesigned gravity-feed cup lets the airbrush be used effectively with only a couple drops of paint, ensuring a fast and thorough clean up<br><br>

· A cutaway handle enables users to grab the needle-chucking nut and quickly pull back the needle to flush paint out of the cup and paint passageways for a quick and easy clean up
<br><br>

· The MAC valve lets users spray a coarse stippling effect to full atomization with a quick turn<br><br>

· For fine line or detail work, it can be adjusted to create the optimum airflow for maximum control of the paint output
<br><br>
· By fully opening the MAC Valve, the airbrush can quickly be cleaned during color changes or for wide background spraying<br><br>
· Taller trigger for extreme control of trigger action and paint flow<br><br></font>

• 4040 Bleed Checker is a hybridized, urethane-acrylic clear used as an inter-coat intended for application over candy2o to prevent the candy2o’s dyes from bleeding into top-coated colors.<br>
• Apply 4040 Bleed Checker over candy2o as an inter-coat.  After 4040 has thoroughly dried (30 – 60 minutes), other colors including subsequent candy2o colors may be applied direct without scuffing.  4040 will prevent the underlying candy2o’s dye from leaching (“bleeding”) into the top-coated colors.<br>
•Apply 4040 Bleed Checker un-reduced, straight from the bottle when applying as an inter-coat over candy2o.  Do not reduce with 4012 Reducer as it’s a solvent used with candy2o and use of it in 4040 will create a shared material between candy2o and 4040 which may allow for bleeding.

From face painting children to the creation of painted ""clothes"" Doug Mitchel follows ten artists as they apply paint to skin. Each artist is represented by one chapter, each chapter follows a ""paint job"" from the initial concept to the application of the final details. Each design is different, but all are colorful and creative. With over 450 color photographs printed on 144 pages, this book documents the techniques and tools used by established artists. Application methods include the brush, airbrush and even markers. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, each has its place and each is covered in detail in this new book from Wolfgang Publications. In addition to the photo sequences with descriptive captions, each chapter includes an interview with the artist. Topics include the way in which the artist learned his or her trade, preferred tools and which paint they prefer to use. The discussion of paint choices includes airbrushed body make up, textile acrylics, liquid latex and markers from companies like Crayola. As pointed out in the captions and the interviews, each material has good points and bad, all are covered in Body Painting. The best teachers are the men and women who have already mastered the skill. Body Painting presents the accumulated wisdom and experience of ten ""teachers"" each of who has a lesson to share with the readers. With a wealth of photos Body Painting is both a colorful look at an emerging art form, and a very useful how-to book"

Here, for the first time, Dave Perewitz tells his story. With journalist and longtime motorcyclist Mike Seate, Perewitz describes the long years, hard work, and unflagging passion that transformed him from a kid with his first motorcycle (a 1964 Harley-Davidson Sportster) into a star riding his latest creation into the Easyriders Bike Show in Dallas while the cameras of the Discovery Channel rolled. The autobiography of a man who has been a major influence in the custom motorcycle industry for 30 years, this absorbing book offers a rare look at how a self-taught designer, mechanic, painter, and fabricator managed to build the American dream his own way, bike by custom bike."

by Mike Seate<br>
When a motorcycle has been built from the ground up, stripped of anything not needed for speed, power, and striking looks, and draped in rich colors and chrome, it has been transformed into a chopper. What was once considered an outlaw ride has now become a luxury item and a mainstream obsession. In Choppers: Heavy Metal Art, author and biker Mike Seate explores the many styles of choppers and bobbers and the builders behind them. The book is divided into several sections based on style or type of chopper, with each section devoted to the builders who follow a similar style and philosophy. Some builders are established names in their field, while others are up-and-comers rocking the chopper world with their far-out ideas and new spins on a classic style. Photographer Michael Lichter, who has photographed choppers for Easyriders and several other magazines for nearly three decades, provides stunning studio images of the featured machines as well as portraits of their creators.</br>",""

          <p>Dagger style pinstriping is the a beautiful way to enhance any vehicle. It is the most popular and most profitable thing I've done for the past 45 years. However, symmetry, design capability and line quality are the three elements that most often elude the beginner and veteran alike. How do you stay consistent, sharp, and imaginative in your work? How do you find new directions to take your work? I have revealed my ""PRACTICE FACTORY"" method that I still use to keep sharp. I also show how to practice and work THROUGH difficult distractions- situations that will stop a pinstriper in his tracks. this video shows how to raise the bar and learn the secrets of pinstriping masters- secrets that I have collected in my long, wonderful and successful career.<br>
            <br>
            I welcome you into my shop and into my ""head"" as I share personal secrets, thought processes, and maneuvers that I have developed and learned from other masters. You will enjoy this video every time you view it, and your growth will be apparent immediately as you make progress faster than ever before.</p>

        <p>Scroll style pinstriping is the most elegant, yet difficult style to master. I have seen many failed attempts at this elusive style, and sympathize with anyone who has picked up a scroll brush and ""gave it a whirl"".<br>
          <br>
          The instruction contained in this video is a result of 45 years of experimentation and perfection of the scroll style. I will show you, through a 2-part instructional session the secrets I have learned and the shortcuts to pinstriping mastery. You CANNOT learn the scroll style by picking up a brush and expecting magic to happen. There are principles and movements necessary to execute good scroll designs. If you have tried and failed, this video is for you.<br>
          <br>
          If you have been trying to design scroll styles, but only end up frustrated, this method can help you. Tired of copying someone else's style? This video is for you. Learn to scroll like a master - have the confidence that every time you pick up the brush, you will design beautiful scroll style pinstriping every time.</p>

Following this, you simply spray our Corrosion Activator directly to the surface and wait – the longer you leave it on the more corroded it will become.<p>

<p>

As this is an organic finish, if you do not protect it, it will continue to corrode. You can inhibit this by applying a clear protective coating of your choice, for example a matte or gloss would work fine. We do suggest you run your own tests as applying clear will potentially change the colors in the corrosion.
<p>

This Flake King Corroded Metal Large Kit contains everything you’re going to need to apply patina to any item:
<p>- 1 x 250g Corroded Coppa<br>
  - 1 x 150g Vintage Iron
    <br>
  - Metal Powder Pick-up Tube
  (for use with Flake King Applicators)<br>
  -
1 x Corrosion Activator
<p><strong><em>ATTENTION:</em></strong> This Kit is designed for the: <a href=""http://www.coastairbrush.com/products.asp?cat=43"">Flake King Applicator</a>
<p><br>
  Why apply our metal powders dry?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>First:</strong> There is no contamination of metal powders in your existing spray equipment it&rsquo;s in our Flake King Dry gun, and whether you&rsquo;re switching from Flake to metal powders it&rsquo;s easy to simply blow the gun through with compressed air.</p>
<p><strong>Second: </strong> The surface of the powder is exposed as it hasn&rsquo;t been applied by a carrier. This makes the process quicker – by spraying the surface with our corroder and that&rsquo;s it. If you&rsquo;re in a hot environment you may have to wrap/cover your item in some plastic allowing it to sweat and corrode – if it&rsquo;s too hot the water will evaporate and reduce the corrosion.</p>

        <h2>REFINED ILLUSTRATION DETAIL</h2>
        <p>Createx Illustration Colors™ are a refined, water-based airbrush colors  optimized for use with Dru Blair&rsquo;s Color Buffer System.   Illustration  Colors offer true fine-line, detailed performance while allowing for  re-wettable effects and subtle erasing techniques.  As the name implies,  Illustration Colors are designed with the illustrator and fine artist  in mind without catering to the demand for high coverage base colors.<br>
          <br>
          Illustration Colors are lightfast.  We use the same exterior-grade  pigments we use to make our Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors.  The  difference is in the resin.  Unlike Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors  which air dry to a cured, non-soluble coating, Illustration Colors are  re-wettable with an amine such as Windex™.  This is one of the key  characteristics behind the creation of our Illustration Colors.  Another  key characteristic this resin offers is subtle erasing.  Illustration  Colors are very easy to erase compared to our resilient Wicked Colors <br>
          <br>
        No reduction necessary.  Illustration Colors atomize and spray excellent  through small airbrush tip sizes down to 0.15mm at low psi settings  straight out of the bottle.  Unlike Wicked Colors, Wicked Detail Colors  and Auto Air Colors which are intended for application with a spray gun  direct from the bottle, Illustration Colors are intended solely for  application with an airbrush and are not designed to cover as a base  color.  Reducer and Transparent Base is offered in our Illustration  Colors line for artists wishing to make colors even thinner or more  transparent based upon subjective preferences, however, most artist will  find performance is excellent straight out of the bottle.</p>

          Tips and Techniques by Steve Riojas</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong>• Shake Well</strong><br>
          <br>
          These  creature colors are comprised of many diff erent pigments, some heavier  than others. The pigments may separate into layers in the bottle while  sitting so be sure to shake the bottle well before using and  periodically while using. You may want to use a soft paint brush to stir  the paint from the sides and bottom of the bottle.<br>
          <br>
          <strong> • Experiment</strong><br>
          <br>
          These  colors are designed to be intermixed to create intermediate hues  allowing you to have colors that are as unique as your creatures.  Experiment and play with mixing and blending the colours.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>• Layers</strong><br>
          <br>
          Apply  your paint using numerous light layers of color. This will allow you to  achieve a greater depth of color and help you to avoid applying too  much paint. Applying layers of diff erent colors also allows you to  achieve the most realistic appearance to your creature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
      <td width=""359"" valign=""top""><h3>APPLICATION HOW-TO's</h3>
        <p>This set of creature paints is designed for the monster/fantasy fan to  help them achieve otherworldly, undead and just plain creepy, skin and  body effects. The different flesh colors are meant to be a starting  point. The mixing and matching of any or all of the colors is limited  only to your imagination!<br>
          <br>
          To paint a classic horror character  such as Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, you can begin with a base coat of Green  Flesh. Then, using a small mixing cup or even your Iwata airbrush cup,  add a few drops of Flesh and a couple of Bone White to lighten the  original green color and spray on as highlights.<br>
          <br>
          To shade, you  can either mix Brown/Black into the original green or Stone Gray for a  more subtle approach. Redness around eyes and scars are easily achieved  with Inner Mouth Flesh which, by the way is perfect for, you guessed it,  the inner mouth!<br>
          <br>
          These monsters always seem to have bulging  veins and Vein Blue/ Green is the color straight out of the bottle for  the most striking look or mix with various flesh colors for an &ldquo;under  the skin&rdquo; effect<br>
          <br>
          This same technique works easily with Purple Flesh as a beginning point  and, if your painting a normal human skin tone just start with Flesh and  use Inner Mouth Flesh for a very natural reddening around the nose,  ears, and cheeks. Flesh mixed with Vein Blue/Green is next followed by  the deepest shadows which can be achieved by a very light spray of  Brown/Black.</p>
        <p>Dinosaurs and other amazing creatures can be realized with this paint  set as well. Raw Umber is a basic base color for most reptilians. Olive  Green sprayed heavily on the back and lightened as you come down the  sides is a classic look. Mixtures with Stone Gray and Brown/Black or any  of the other colors for that matter will only add to the fun.<br>
          <br>
          Teeth,  bone, and horns can be achieved with a simple 1, 2, 3, of Bone White  followed by a light shading of Raw Umber from the base of the tooth,  horn, or crevasse of bone easing as you reach the tip, followed again by  Brown/Black. Spray from the very base of the tooth, horn, etc., and  fade up to create a worn effect.<br>
          <br>
          Of course these creature colors  can be enhanced by the great selection of Com-Art Paints already  available. Adding any of the red shades to Olive Green, for instance  will create a multitude of shades and hues in that color range alone. I  formulated these colors to help begin the journey into fantasy, horror  and monster painting. The rest, if you decide to venture there, is up to  you!<br>

This water based size is ready for leafing just 25 minutes after applying to desired surface. Once dry, it will remain tacky for 24 to 36 hours. This water-based size has a mild odor and is non-flammable, making it a better choice comparing with the oil-based size, that may cause problems.

 <p>

How to use Water Based Size: Surface preparation is crucial to obtaining a good-looking and long lasting leafing project. Surfaces must be smooth and free of any dust, oils, wax and fingerprints. If applying size over a previously finished object, the surfaces must be cleaned and lightly sanded, and a small area should be tested to ensure compatibility. Porous surfaces should be filled with a sealer/primer that is compatible with the substrate. Clean up with water. The Water Based Size will freeze. Store in a heated area and avoid shipping during winter months.

A unique ""Pistol Grip"" airbrush, the Eclipse G6 airbrush looks like a miniature spray gun, but sprays and performs like a large airbrush with its 0.6-mm stainless-steel nozzle.

· Equipped with a long tapered needle that ensures a smooth transition between fine-to-wide background spray

· Utilizes a dual-purpose air cap and a fan adjustment valve that lets the airbrush spray a round or oval pattern

· The round pattern is useful for painting graphics, while the oval shape creates a smooth background spray

· Uses a special fitting so airbrush bottles can be used instead of a gravity-feed cup, allowing for multiple color bottles to be interchanged quickly without having to clean a cup thoroughly - another unique feature for this type of spray unit - optional gravity-feed cups available

· Works well with the Iwata Studio Series Power Jet and Power Jet Lite Compressors

Iwata Eclipse Series airbrushes are known for their versatility. Eclipse's high flow allows it to atomize a wider variety of liquids with less need for reducing or thinning. Eclipse Series offers a broad spray range, as compared to other airbrushes, where it is possible to achieve a controlled fine line to controlled wide spray. 
<p>
Iwata Eclipse HP-BCS Siphon Feed Dual Action Airbrush is a great choice for those who intend to use a larger volume of spray medium. One of the benefits of siphon feed airbrushes is that you can purchase additional bottles and prefill them with your favorite colors. This allows you to achieve quick color changes.
<p>
Iwata Eclipse Series airbrushes feature an exclusive compression fit nozzle that is easy to clean and assemble. The quick flush cutaway handle allows easy access to the needle so that you can quickly empty the paint reservoir for cleaning. Iwata's spring-steel needle resists breakage and our needle packings are solvent resistant for longevity. Iwata Eclipse airbrushes come with a head cap spanner that is used to remove the head cap when accessing the nozzle. Also included is Iwata Lube, which is used to lubricate the needle and main lever mechanism.

The EBA Endura SFX Edition was inspired by the show Face Off which can be seen only on Syfy. Selected Face Off artists assisted in creating and developing certain shades making this collection a truly unique piece of art.<br><br>

Endura Face Off SFX<br>
Endura SFX Edition consists of six primary and four special/SFX colors designed to create all sorts of skin effects including fresh and dried blood, cuts, bruises, burns, scars, skin irritations, black eyes, veins, contusions, and etc. <br><br>

The six primary colors (black, white, yellow, red, blue and green) provide a neutral look that is not overly bright nor overly dark and are used primarily to combine and blend with the fx colors. The four SFX colors (fresh blood, dried blood, mauve and bruise red) can be combined and blended with other colors or used completely alone to create highly realistic skin distortion effects. The Fresh Blood comes with a slightly yellow undertone and is designed to achieve a fresh looking oxygenated blood effect. On the other hand, the Dried Blood provides a slightly darker shade to create the illusion of fresh dried blood (not an aged blood). Use Mauve Flesh Tone to create natural looking burns, cuts and irritations or highlights where a pink tone is desired. The Bruise Red tone can create bruises and contusions with a red undertone. When used in combination with primary colors and Bruise Purple (see EBA Face Off Undead Edition) the Bruise Red can assist in creating anything from classic color changing bruises and black eyes to deep cuts and contusions.</p>",""

Endura Face Off Undead<br>
The EBA Endura Undead Edition consists of over 20 different shades and pigments carefully blended to create 10 unique colors designed to create countless undead and dead special effects and characters including zombies, vampires, monsters, ghosts, witches, devils, dead flesh, venous blood, aged blood, rotting flesh, pale skin, etc.<br><br>

The Vein Blood creates a realistic looking dark blood color with a purple undertone coming from the veins. This specific color of Endura was carefully produced to imitate shade of blood that created when there is an absence of oxygen in the blood. On the other hand, the Aged Blood is a perfect choice to use when looking to achieve dried/old blood effect with a slightly brown undertone. Pale Dead and Warm Grey can be used when looking for a base skin color with pale-light tone. The Pale Dead comes with a yellow- grey undertone while the Warm Grey provides light grey with a red undertone. Both colors can be altered, layered and blended with other colors to provide different tones. The Vein Tone is neither green nor blue and can be applied directly on the skin or under Endura SKT (skin tones) to provide realistic looking veins. To achieve bruises and contusions artists can use Bruise Purple that will provide a natural bruise tone with a deep purple undertone. Other colors including Night Swamp, Dirty Brown, Charcoal and Nicotine Stain can be used alone or blending/layered to create a countless number of characters and effects.</p>",""

Save time, save material and save money! Simply add flake, open the flake valve, set the pressure and you’re ready to go.</p>

<p>Its Key Benefits Are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Minimizes the amount of flake you use<br>
    </li>
  <li>Reduces the volume of catalyzed clear that you use<br>
    </li>
  <li>Reduces the risk of clear coat failure   &amp; potential “sagging” of flake and clear<br>
    </li>
  <li>Increase speed significantly – we’re talking by days for a large job<br>
    </li>
  <li>Improves the clean up process – because the flake is dry when applied, it simply brushes up/off.<br>
    </li>
  <li>Reduces risk of cross contamination of future paint jobs<br>
    </li>
  <li>Because you have a dry flake gun, there is no longer flake in your clear coat gun again reducing the risk of flake ending up in future paint jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This little gun will save you money all round, when you’ve used it – you will wonder how you ever flaked before.</p>
<p>New improvements include a solid machined lid, made out of aluminum. It's pretty much bullet proof.</p>
<p>It’s your call, you decide how important maintaining your work flow is!</p>

  <li>Because you have a dry flake gun, there is no longer flake in your clear coat gun again reducing the risk of flake ending up in future paint jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This little gun will save you money all round, when you’ve used it – you will wonder how you ever flaked before.</p>
<p>New improvements include a solid machined lid, made out of aluminum. It's pretty much bullet proof.</p>
<p>It’s your call, you decide how important maintaining your work flow is!</p>

Available in 100ml, 500ml & 1 Litre Bottles<p>

FK50 Surface binder is a water based adhesion product, that can applied by brush, dabbed on with a sponge or sprayed on with Spray gun or Airbrush (when thinned with FK55 Thinners).<p>

Developed to stay open longer than a typical solvent or existing water based product with reduced potential of sagging when applied in a medium to wet coat. Its primary use is for the application of our Dry Metal Flakes (Industrial/Commercial Glitters) and our dry blended metal powders.
<p>
Why is it better than, for example a solvent binder or 2k clear?
<p>
Well as it’s water based, it’s better for the environment, inert will not react with previously applied products, easier to ship (worldwide) and there are no sensible limitations on how many coats that can be applied (within reason).
<p>
It also produces a nice clean edge, for masking removal, allowing you to now be able to produce colored flake designs rather than traditional methods of silver base and colored “candy” dyes on top. Colored flake will last longer in direct sunlight than candy dye based products.
<p>
An additional bonus the FK50 Surface binder when applied over a complete flaked area, reduces the amount of clear coat required.
<p>
FK50 will adhere to properly prepared surfaces such as existing finishes, primer, plastic, vinyl, fiberglass, wood and most substrates.

            <li>4050 UVLS Gloss is the recommended carrier for candy2o. It replaces 4030 Balancing Clear as it allows for a more even and heavier color coat. 4050 is especially recommended when applying with a spray-gun.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Airbrush</strong>: Any tip-size, 18 – 27 psi
              <ul>
                <li>Add 4050 10% - 300% per vol., then</li>
                <li>thin with 4011 Reducer 5% - 10% + per vol.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Spray Gun:</strong> 1.2 – 1.3mm, 18 – 22 psi
              <ul>
                <li>Mix 4050 6:1 candy2o</li>
                <li>Thinning with 4011 Reducer is often not required.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Allow candy2o mix to acclimate for 10+ minutes before spraying.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Apply <a href=""https://www.coastairbrush.com/proddetail.asp?prod=Bleed_Checker"" target=""_blank"">4040 Bleed Checker</a> over candy2o to prevent bleeding [leaching] of the dyes into top-coated colors or clear.</p>

        <h2>REFINED ILLUSTRATION DETAIL</h2>
        <p>Createx Illustration Colors™ are a refined, water-based airbrush colors  optimized for use with Dru Blair&rsquo;s Color Buffer System.   Illustration  Colors offer true fine-line, detailed performance while allowing for  re-wettable effects and subtle erasing techniques.  As the name implies,  Illustration Colors are designed with the illustrator and fine artist  in mind without catering to the demand for high coverage base colors.<br>
          <br>
          Illustration Colors are lightfast.  We use the same exterior-grade  pigments we use to make our Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors.  The  difference is in the resin.  Unlike Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors  which air dry to a cured, non-soluble coating, Illustration Colors are  re-wettable with an amine such as Windex™.  This is one of the key  characteristics behind the creation of our Illustration Colors.  Another  key characteristic this resin offers is subtle erasing.  Illustration  Colors are very easy to erase compared to our resilient Wicked Colors <br>
          <br>
        No reduction necessary.  Illustration Colors atomize and spray excellent  through small airbrush tip sizes down to 0.15mm at low psi settings  straight out of the bottle.  Unlike Wicked Colors, Wicked Detail Colors  and Auto Air Colors which are intended for application with a spray gun  direct from the bottle, Illustration Colors are intended solely for  application with an airbrush and are not designed to cover as a base  color.  Reducer and Transparent Base is offered in our Illustration  Colors line for artists wishing to make colors even thinner or more  transparent based upon subjective preferences, however, most artist will  find performance is excellent straight out of the bottle.</p>

<font color=""white"">IMPORTANT: Operating pressure is the pressure at which the compressor will turn on and shut off. Working pressure is the pressure the compressor will work at when using your airbrush or spray gun with it. Operating pressure will vary depending on what is being used on the compressor. For recommendations on the correct unit for your application, please call Coast Airbrush and speak with a representative. </font><br><br>The Great White Shark features a 5/8 hp motor, a fan that blows air across the head of the motor, a radiator that cools the air before it reaches the coalescent filter and a large capacity 4-gallon air tank that sits at the top of the unit, allowing moisture to drop out of the line before reaching the tank.<br>

Before reaching your airbrush, the air is filtered one last time after it leaves the tank. The Great White even looks different than other compressors with the components housed in a dual-roll bar cage-on-wheels for easy, safe transport.<br>

· Large 4-gallon tank mounted above the motor for better balance and moisture separation
<br>
· 5-micron moisture filter is the final stage for assuring dry, clean air
<br>
· 99.99% efficient, the filter separates out oil and water BEFORE it reaches the tank. The maintenance-free filter automatically drains when full<br>

· Rugged 5/8 hp motor designed with a finned head for maximum cooling and durability
<br>
· The pressure regulator provides accurate pressure settings from 0 ­ 100 psi, allowing the maximum use from your airbrush
<br>
· An extra-long (10') and heavy-duty power cord allows direct connection into your power receptacle therefore eliminating any overheating problems developed by an undersized extension cord<br>

· Sturdy wheels allow the compressors to be easily transported</p>

• Attaches to the air inlet of your airbrush, providing grip and balance.<br><br>

• Designed with a large dial to allow easy air pressure adjustments. This is particularly helpful when spraying and adjusting air pressures simultaneously.<br><br>

• Capable of achieving fine adjustments to give precise air flow control. Three full dial rotations to change from zero air flow to full air flow.<br><br>

• Ideal for stippling applications. Accurately control stippling size while you're painting real-time. With a simple turn of the dial, the G-MAC™ gives you the ability to produce course stippling effects to full atomization.<br><br>

• For fine lines and detailed work, use the G-MAC™ to precisely produce optimal airflow for infinite control of paint output.<br><br>

• Fully open the G-MAC™ to allow maximum air flow for wide background spraying and to quickly clean your airbrush during color changes.</p>"

This new book from Wolfgang Publications explains how to disassemble, clean and repair all the major brands. Even the best airbrush in the world isn't any good without a source of air. Steve discusses different compressor types and the advantages or disadvantages of each. Two chapters explain airbrush painting basics - from types of paint to trigger control, and the three basic strokes all painters need to know. Steve closes the book with a gallery of airbrush art, and an airbrush buyer's guide to help readers choose wisely when they buy their first, or their fifth, airbrush. 144 pages, over 500 color images.",""

The individuals included here include Edward Reed, Steve Nunez, Susan Heidi, Liz Austin, and Tom Nguyen. Each photo sequence starts with the artist's sketch, before moving, step-by-step, to the finished panel. The human form, the human face, and skin tones, are three topics that beginning artists struggle to get right. And it is these three topics that make up much of the discussion in this new book. Each chapter includes a Q&A with the artist. These interviews allow the reader to experience the artist, one-on-one. This is a chance to learn not only which airbrush they artist prefer, but also how they learned their skills, who inspires them and how to avoid the typical mistakes. The styles seen in How to Airbrush Pinups run the gamut from retro pinup and Vargas-style work of Edward Reed to modern stylized pinups of Tom Nguyen. Each artist adds his or her own spin to the classic female shape, and each explains in both words and photos how to create the allure that makes pin-up art one of the most popular art forms in the world.

Thanks to the iron-on T-shirt boom of the '70s and a raft of younger artists working today, hot rod monsters have persevered. Now award-winning car-designer Thom Taylor and legendary kustom culture figure Ed Newton reveal the tricks and techniques used by masters past and present to render these whack rods and their warts-and-all drivers. Beginning with a brief history of the form, the authors examine figures like Stanley Mouse, Ed Roth, and Newton himself, then reveal how those pioneers influenced modern artists like Keith Weesner, John Bell, and Dave Deal, to name a few. In addition to offering chapters covering topics like equipment, perspective, light sources, and other technical considerations, Taylor expands on the cartooning, proportion, and color chapters from his previous works, applying them to the subject at hand.

Illustration Colors are lightfast.  We use the same exterior-grade pigments we use to make our Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors.  The difference is in the resin.  Unlike Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors which air dry to a cured, non-soluble coating, Illustration Colors are re-wettable with an amine such as Windex™.  This is one of the key characteristics behind the creation of our Illustration Colors.  Another key characteristic this resin offers is subtle erasing.  Illustration Colors are very easy to erase compared to our resilient Wicked Colors 
<br>
No reduction necessary.  Illustration Colors atomize and spray excellent through small airbrush tip sizes down to 0.15mm at low psi settings straight out of the bottle.  Unlike Wicked Colors, Wicked Detail Colors and Auto Air Colors which are intended for application with a spray gun direct from the bottle, Illustration Colors are intended solely for application with an airbrush and are not designed to cover as a base color.  Reducer and Transparent Base is offered in our Illustration Colors line for artists wishing to make colors even thinner or more transparent based upon subjective preferences, however, most artist will find performance is excellent straight out of the bottle.<br><br>"

SG150 Intercoat Pearl & Flake Karrier is an innovative mid-coat material designed specifically for use with Pearls, Flakes, and other dry products offered in the House of Kolor product line. The unique chemistry actually encapsulates pearl and flake particles, locking them into place so that the settling, blotching and streaking  that can occur when using other carriers is greatly reduced if not completely eliminated. SG150 appears to be semi-opaque but dries to a clear finish to release all the brilliancy of the pearls. It is NOT intended as a final clear coat and MUST be topped with a final clear.",""

<div>Start airbrushing with an All-Star! The Iwata Deluxe Airbrush Kit with Eclipse HP-CS is one of the most complete kits from Iwata and makes an amazing gift for the airbrush enthusiast in your life.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The Eclipse HP-CS is a favorite of a professionals and hobbyists alike because it atomizes a wider variety of liquids with less need for reducing or thinning. The Eclipse HP-CS also offers a broad spray range, as compared to other airbrushes, where it is possible to achieve a controlled fine line to controlled wide spray. It has a generous 0.24 oz / 7 ml fluid cup with lid that is ideal for color mixing and easy clean up. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The Eclipse CS features an exclusive compression fit nozzle that is easy to clean and assemble. The quick flush cutaway handle allows easy access to the needle so that you can quickly empty the paint reservoir for cleaning. Iwata's spring-steel needle resists breakage and our needle packings are solvent resistant for longevity. Iwata Eclipse airbrushes come with a head cap spanner that is used to remove the head cap when accessing the nozzle. Also included is Iwata Lube, which is used to lubricate the needle and main lever mechanism. Hugely popular, the Eclipse CS delivers all-star versatility.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We pair the HP-CS with an Iwata Smart Jet Airbrush Compressor - the most popular choice for low to medium pressure applications. Iwata Smart Jet airbrush compressor is compact and quiet, producing a preset working pressure of 20-25 PSI.  It is a good choice for general purpose applications that require low to medium air pressure. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Iwata Smart Jet is equipped with auto shut-off technology, which enables the compressor to shut itself off when not in use. This feature upgrade is known to lengthen the life span of the compressor motor because it reduces the workload of the motor over time. Iwata Smart Jet has a moisture filter that prevents pulsation and traps condensation, delivering clean, dry air. The mounted pressure gauge displays the air pressure and if desired, the bleed valve airflow adjustment may be used to lower the working pressure below the preset range. (Note: auto shut off functionality will be bypassed when using the bleed valve). The Smart Jet has an air intake filter that protects the motor from dust and particulates and allows easy-access for quick filter changes.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Iwata Smart Jet comes with a built-in airbrush holder and a high strength polyurethane airbrush hose for Iwata airbrushes. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>To make sure you have a great experience with this kit we also include ten 1 oz bottles of Com Art Colours - half transparent and half opaque, 8oz bottle of Medea Airbrush Cleaner, an Iwata Pistol-Grip Moisture Filter, an Artool Freehand Airbrush Template, and two how to airbrush DVDs. </div>
<div><br>
</div>

<div>• Iwata Eclipse HP-CS Gravity Feed Dual Action Airbrush</div>
<div>• Iwata Smart Jet 110-120V Airbrush Compressor with Airbrush Hose</div>

Take your art on-the-go with Iwata Maxx Jet. This powerful airbrush compressor is built-into a convenient rolling-case that has storage space for your stuff. It is ideal when you need low to high output from 1-60 psi. The dual manifold air compressor is set up to operate one airbrush and one mini spray gun such as Iwata Eclipse G Series and RG-3. 
<p>
Iwata Maxx Jet is equipped with a pressure gauge that displays the tank pressure in the 2.5 liter air storage tank and the gauge on the regulator displays the working pressure. The moisture filter traps condensation within the cup delivering clean, dry air. Using the adjustment levers on the manifold, you can independently regulate the air pressure to each air hose, giving you total control. Auto shut-off technology enables the compressor to shut itself off when not in use. This feature upgrade is known to lengthen the life span of the compressor motor because it reduces the workload of the motor over time.  The powerful two pole 1/6 hp motor is oil-less, has a 2.5 liter air storage tank and stays cool with the built-in internal cooling fan. The air intake filter protects the motor from dust and particulates and is designed for easy-access filter cleaning. The protective travel case includes a convenient retractable handle. The detachable top opens a handy storage tray and the case contains two built-in storage drawers. Turn the unit on and off with a convenient switch mounted into the outer case and when you are finished you can detach the power cord for convenient mobility.
<p>
Iwata Maxx Jet includes two braided air hoses. One is fitted for Iwata airbrushes and the other for Iwata Mini Spray Guns. Also included is an airbrush and spray gun holder and regulator holder. We include a replacement air intake filter and adapter fittings for Badger, Aztek and Paasche brand airbrushes. Also included is a detailed operation manual.
<p>
Optional expansion storage tray sold separately.

We proudly offer five sizes of these innovative brushes.<p>

Size 00 - The 00 is probably favored for lines on most cars. Other brands of brushes include the size 00, but when you use our other sizes the reason for us making a variety becomes clear.<p>

Size 0 - The size 0 brush performs all longliner functions as the size 1, just not as heavy. Synthetic and natural hairs are used for long life, line consistency, and control.
<p>
Size 1 - Size 1, the largest brush of this series, holds lots of paint and will do over a ¼"" (6.4 mm) line with ease. It will also do fine lines with less pressure perfectly.
<p>
5/0 - The 5/0 is the finest longliner brush available. It will lay pin lines for incredible distances with ease and beautiful line quality. It soon will become the standard for the fine line stripers everywhere.
<p>
3/0 - The 3/0 will match any brush currently available for fine line work, but surpasses them all for durability, line quality, and control."

All Kafka pinstriping brushes turn corners without ""flare-out"" and without the user ""rolling the brush"" — simply lift and work the tip to create designs that usually take years to master.

They are all extremely versatile but could be considered specific relative to their size. The brushes are best used between 55 and 80 degrees to the surface of the work.<p>
All Kafka signature series pinstriping brushes can turn corners without “flare-out” and without the user “rolling the brush”— just lift and work the tip for designs that usually take years to master. Works equally well with urethanes and oil-based enamels. Made by master brush makers to last and perform longer than any brush ... ever.<p>

Striper, Size 0 - The size 0 brush is the smallest available. It's capable of turning very tight corners and very fine design work while still maintaining great line consistency due to the nature of design and combination of synthetic and natural hair.<p>

Striper, Size 1 - The size 1 is slightly larger than the 0 and will perform the same as the 0 with a slightly heavier line. As with all the Kafka brushes, they perform with oil-based enamels as well as urethane striping paint.
<p>
Striper, Size 3 - The size 3 will work in a wide variety of applications from scroll striping to shorter, long-line designs. This brush will give the user greater control in all applications and flatten the learning curve for novice stripers. The size 3 is also the most used favorite of its designer, Steve Kafka.
<p>
Striper, Size 5 - The size 5, which is slightly larger than the size 3, holds more paint and will accomplish heavier designs with ease. Depending on pressure, the line thickness can reach 1/4"" and fine lines to 1/16"" in the other direction. This brush is a favorite for outlining larger flame layouts, cars, trucks, and semi trucks.
<p>
Striper, Size 6 - The size 6 will give you the heavier lines needed in many instances, but still can deliver delicate design work. It's used for initial layouts followed by smaller sizes for more delicate additions in beautiful combinations.</p>"

Professional freelance photographer James Potter captured the epicenter of this landmark scene in what was then suburban Los Angeles. In this photographic history of that time and place, Thom Taylor presents the best of Potter’s collection depicting the cars of “Kustomland.” Two- and four-page features on two-dozen renowned customs from mild to radical feature not only Potter’s exemplary work, but brief capsule histories of the cars and their owners and captions detailing the cars’ features. Taylor also includes features on legendary custom painter Larry Watson and the Renegades car club, as well as a biography of Potter and a historic overview of Kustomland and the areas it encompassed."

While the LPH400 LVB remains the set-up for the most difficult or complex colors the LPH400 LVX handles all the middle range colors where productivity and speed is a must.","Extensive field-testing and painter evaluation reports prove that the LPH400 LVX is much faster than the competition and has an ultra smooth application with no technique change. Inlet pressures, spray distance and overlap are the same for the LPH400 LVX as a normal LPH400.<br>

Hybrid metallic, regular metallic, xyrillic and regular pearls need more than a one-gun set-up to achieve the best color match and performance. Therefore, the LPH400 LVX eXtreme basecoat gun performs best with 90-95% of these basecoat colors and for the other 5-10%, the LPH400 LVB is the best solution.

The LPH400 LVX is also eXtremely proficient with waterborne coatings and gives an added advantage for waterborne basecoat application in hot dry climates.</br>"

“If you’re looking for a brush with a little attitude and a little extra shape the Purple Armadillo Angle will deliver. It’s an excellent brush for rough surfaces like brick and block. It also works fine on smooth surfaces. Its synthetic bristles hold it shape and is easy to clean up. Works great with acrylic based paints. Works excellent as a pictorial brush. If you need something with a little attitude and you like the feel of an angle brush the Purple Armadillo Angle is what you need.” - Scott ""Cornbread"" Lindley</p>"

The mythical beast has been captured! Tidwell strapped on his mountain gear, threw a couple redbulls in his back pack, kissed Sarah, the 5 dogs, and his pet alligator good bye as he headed off into the untamed wilderness of the Kentucky hills in search of a mystical beast that has been haunting his dreams... SASQUATCH! We are happy to report that Tidwell was found wandering naked in a Wal-mart parking lot with both hands full of hair... he could only say two words... "" 'SQUATCH WHISKERS "".  Without delay, we sent these mystical hairs off to MACK Brush Co to be turned into what will go down in history as the greatest leap forward in striping brush technology since the first cave man used an entire squirrel to paint marks on cave walls. Unfortunately, there are only enough whiskers to make 250 brushes of each size, #00 and #000, so get them while you can. The #00 and #000 have the same length hairs, this is the first and only #000 pinstriping brush Mack has ever made with full length hairs and it is AMAZING. Size marked with Tidwell's signature brass knuckles.<br>

The featured project is a larger scale image rendered primarily in grayscale, with accent color at the very end. The increased dimension is designed to make you to feel more relaxed while working the project and to keep you from being governed by size. Working in grayscale forces you to focus on the development of the image using value and contrast without being fettered with color. While masking is used in the initial layout of the composition, this assignment is primarily an exercise in honing freehand skills and putting fundamental art techniques to practical expression. 
<br>
As with other Mike Learn DVDs, FUSION comes packaged with the vinyl mask and Mike's exclusive ""Curvey"" shield to give you everything you need to work side by side and follow along with the instruction. Bonus scenes and extras add fun and additional training through chalkboard breakout sessions. AND, because you asked, we included even more footage and have 
packed FUSION as our first 2-Disk Set!"

PRO TIP: Rub Cabana Tan into your entire body, just like lotion. (Don't forget the face, it won't clog pores!) Thoroughly wash your hands. THEN, rub regular body lotion onto your entire hands and feet. This will blend the sunless tanner perfectly on these difficult areas. The hands and feet are always the trickiest when doing sunless tanning. The skin is often dry and absorbs a lot of sunless tanner. Rubbing in a little body lotion helps to slightly dilute the DHA for a very real looking tan.<br><br>

bronzed look under the sun or a tanning bed. Unfortunately, the  
consequences of too many years of sunbathing and sunburns result in  
premature wrinkles, brown spots, and worst of all, skin cancer (the  
most commonly diagnosed cancer!) In fact, tanning beds emit more  
dangerous UVA rays in a shorter period of time than does the sun.  
Tanning beds can also damage your eye sight and immune system, and if  
not properly sanitized, can be a haven for bacteria.<br><br>

MMP paint is very easy to use. We recommend thinning to the following ratio for the best performance. Below are some basic examples. For best performance please follow our carefully researched ratios.<p>

<p>All paints are airbrush ready. By nature all paint may vary in consistency based on pigment. You may find some paints to be slightly thicker than others which are natural properties of paint. We do not add any additional additives to our paints which results in no shelf life , hard settles or breakdown.<p>

MMP paint is very easy to use. We recommend thinning to the following ratio for the best performance. Below are some basic examples. For best performance please follow our carefully researched ratios.<p>

DO NOT MIX 50/50. Our thinner is very powerful and only the smallest amount of thinner is needed. In the mixing cup your reduced paint will appear thicker than what you may be used to. This is normal. MMP paint will dry smooth, thin and level. It will not hide the finest of details. Mixed properly you will find a beautiful opaque finish which requires minimal coats.<p>

All paint should be stirred not shaken in the paint cup. <p>

Polyurethane Intermix  <p>

1-2 drops to 10 drops paint   ( Stir in only do not shake ) <p>

2-4 drops  to 20 drops paint  ( stir  in only do not shake ) <p>

20/30% MMP thinner to 1 part paint ( 2/3 drops thinner to 10 drops paint)<p>

20/30% MMP thinner to 2 part paint ( 2/3 drops thinner to 20 drops paint )<p>

PSI 10 , 15 , 20 depending on your needs.<p>

TIP: add one or two drops of MMP Polyurethane Intermix for additional reduced tip dry when spraying straight from the bottle. MMP Poly increases flow , lowers drying times , added leveling , increased blending when brush painting, durability and adds a slight eggshell finish.

MMP paint is very easy to use. We recommend thinning to the following ratio for the best performance. Below are some basic examples. For best performance please follow our carefully researched ratios.<p>

DO NOT MIX 50/50. Our thinner is very powerful and only the smallest amount of thinner is needed. In the mixing cup your reduced paint will appear thicker than what you may be used to. This is normal. MMP paint will dry smooth, thin and level. It will not hide the finest of details. Mixed properly you will find a beautiful opaque finish which requires minimal coats.<p>

All paint should be stirred not shaken in the paint cup. <p>

Polyurethane Intermix  <p>

1-2 drops to 10 drops paint   ( Stir in only do not shake ) <p>

2-4 drops  to 20 drops paint  ( stir  in only do not shake ) <p>

20/30% MMP thinner to 1 part paint ( 2/3 drops thinner to 10 drops paint)<p>

20/30% MMP thinner to 2 part paint ( 2/3 drops thinner to 20 drops paint )<p>

PSI 10 , 15 , 20 depending on your needs.<p>

TIP: add one or two drops of MMP Polyurethane Intermix for additional reduced tip dry when spraying straight from the bottle. MMP Poly increases flow , lowers drying times , added leveling , increased blending when brush painting, durability and adds a slight eggshell finish.

 Max Pressure: 125PSI. Max Flow Capacity: 20CFM</p>

This unique product is the only in-line disposable filter that features a color change indicator, signaling time to change the filter. Attaching directly to the spray gun, the Motor Guard Mini Desiccant Dryer removes all traces of water vapor, aerosols and dirt, providing crucial protection for final blow off of body panels and for all stages of painting including the critical application of clear-coats. The key to the performance of the Motor Guard Mini Desiccant Dryer lies in its unique, patented design. A 5 micron, porous bronze element removes fine dirt particles, an oil-absorbent media removes the smallest traces of oil vapor and a charge of desiccant beads traps airborne moisture delivering air to the spray gun at an incredible -40-Degree dew point. The filter features a clear polycarbonate housing and view ports in the nylon guard allow for easy viewing of the moisture indicating desiccant beads. When the bead color changes completely from dark blue (-40-Degree dew point) to pink (0-Degree dew point), the filter should be replaced. The Motor Guard Mini Desiccant Dryer provides a last line of defense against airborne contaminants that are commonly picked up downstream of wall-mounted filtration units and in the air hose leading to the spray gun.<p>"

A historical and visual overview of pinstriping culture, the book takes readers into all the great shops - from Circle City Hot Rods and Baron Speed Shop to Romance of Rust and The Paintbox - and right into the action as a variety of rides ranging from hot rods and lowriders to old-school choppers and bobbers are striped up. Today's influential contemporaries are featured, such as Art Schilling, Jimmy C, Steve Chazyeka, and Herb Martinez in the United States; Tom Plate, John Leeson and Neil Meillard in Europe; Makoto Kobayashi in Japan; and Simon Watts in Australia.",""

            <p>Adding 4030 to Createx paints: <br>
              • Improves flow and reduces tip-dry <br>
              • Decreases surface tension allowing for heavier coats without cratering and improves leveling <br>
              • Increases adhesion and mar resistance <br>
              • Reduces drying times </p>
            <p>4030 is generally added 10 – 25% per volume to Createx paints; when using candy2o, 4030 is added in greater amounts. 4030 is not recommended for use with AutoBorne Sealers, Scenix Mural & Theme Paints or SSR Clears. Refer to color for specific 4030 mix amounts. </p>
            <p>candy2o is concentrated in the bottle and is intended for mixing with 4030 to achieve a stable resin load. <br>
              <br>
              • Airbrush: mix 4030 30 – 50% per volume <br>
              • Spray gun: mix 4030 1:1. Add 4030 and candy2o in equal amounts for a less-concentrated candy which is easier to control with a more gradual build-up of color. </p>
            <p>4030 is a resin and may be added in any ratio without affecting adhesion. Adding 4030 to paint does increase transparency. </p>
            <p>Add 4030 to paint, then dilute with 4012. After mixing thoroughly, allow paint 10 minutes to acclimate to additives before spraying for optimum spray performance, especially when applying with a spraygun.</p>

Currently, Eddie Davis paints at Airbrush Headquarters in Destin, Florida, and lives in nearby Shalimar with his wife and two children.  Growing up in the 1970’s and 1980’s, Davis’s main influences came from Heavy Metal, Creepy, Eerie, andThrasher Skateboarding magazines, and The Savage Sword of Conan art. “My sense of proportion and dynamic lighting came from trying to emulate great artists such as Richard Corben, Bernie Wrightson, Tim Vigil, and Pushead. I always admired how they could use dark subject matter to convey emotion and a sense of presence and tension. For me the most profound and fun part of the whole artistic process is when you get to that place where the painting tells you what it wants, and you’re just adding color and keeping the gun moving.”"

 Constructed of durable stainless steel and extruded aluminum, these light boxes offer a comfortably slanted 24"" x 36"" 
(61 x 91 cm) surface for more convenient viewing and tracing. The translucent surface is flush-mounted for a clean 
and completely unobstructed flat work surface. Accurate 90 degree edges offer precise reference for measuring and
 attaching T-squares. The near-perfect illumination is created by the combination of 5000K fluorescent lamps and a 
specially designed polyester pearlescent reflector system. The result is a brilliant viewing window that is free of 
hot spots or shadows. Unlike any other light box, these new light boxes feature a unique front storage compartment 
that is cleverly hidden under the rounded wrist rest. Pencils, pens, embossing stylus, rulers and many other tools
 can be stored for easy access. A handy finger recess for carrying, and cord strap, combine to make these Artograph 
light boxes portable and highly practical. The Artograph ProSeries Light Box is available in 5 different sizes and 8
 lamp configurations.","*  Slanted 24"" x 36"" (61 x 91 cm) work surface for comfortable tracing and viewing<br>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Allow candy2o mix to acclimate for 10+ minutes before spraying.</li>

The Browns<br>

Opaque Raw Umber can be used for medium brown colored bark on trees as well as patches of dirt, or to simulate a dirt road or footpaths. Lastly, it can be used, sparingly, to make the leaves on plants appear to be dead or sun stressed. Raw Umber may be combined with Opaque Iron Yellow to create a more yellow-orange mud hue or to create late fall foliage.<br><br>

Opaque Burnt Umber is the dark brown colour that can be used to create the dark bark on trees, stumps and plants as well as dirt buildup on rocks and crevices. Burnt Umber also can be sprayed on groundfoam and scenery to create exposed patches of dirt in fields, lawns, freight yards and industrial areas. Both burnt and Raw Umber can be airbrushed on the leafy areas of trees to give the appearance of winter “dead” vegetation.<br><br>

The Greens
<br>
The Real Deal Scenery Kit contains two shades of Green. The two colours can be combined and intermixed with the yellows or even blue to create a wide variety of intermediate shades of green for plants, tree leaves, weeds and grasses. Using a variety of shades and colours give a more realistic appearance than a single colour of ground foam.<br><br>

Opaque Sap Green is the brighter of the greens in the set. By itself, it can create the late spring/early summer leaves and plants. It can be mixed with Transparent Black or Opaque Raw or Burnt Umber to change the hue for late summer or fall vegetation.<br><br>

The Yellows<br>

Opaque Iron Yellow is a wonderful colour to create sun-burned grass, the leaves on Aspen trees, and fall leaves. It also makes an excellent colour to adjust any of the rust hues. The dirt colours also can be adjusted with the Raw Sienna to provide a more orange/yellow hue to dirt.<br><br>

Opaque Deep Yellow is the colour of choice to create bright yellow flowers such as dandelions or daffodils. Deep Yellow can be used to make the bright yellow leaves of Aspen trees and bright fall foliage. Bright orange hues can be created by adding in tiny amounts of Toluedene Red.<br><br><br>

<i>Tips and Techniques by Leslie Eaton</i>
<br><br>
Shake Well<br>

These scenery colors are comprised of many different pigments, some heavier than others. The pigments may separate into layers in the bottle while sitting so be sure to shake the bottle well before using and periodically while using. You may want to use a soft paint brush to stir the paint from the sides and bottom of the bottle.<br><br>

Experiment<br>

These colors are designed to be intermixed to create intermediate hues allowing you to have colors that are unique as the scenery you are creating. Lighter shades can be made by adding Opaque White. Darker shades can be achieved by adding Transparent Black or even Opaque Burnt Umber. Enjoy experimenting and playing with mixing the colors.<br><br>

Layers<br>

Add soft color changes to your scenery using numerous light layers of color. This will allow you to achieve the natural, subtle changes that are seen in nature and help you to avoid having leopard-spotted landscapes. Applying fine layers of different colors also allows you to achieve the most realistic appearance to your scenery. <br><br>"

The Browns<br>
Light Dust can be used for very light shades of dirt or ballast, or to simulate a light coat of very fine dirt. It also can be used to make the white or off-white lettering in signs, model train cars, or armor to appear to be streaking. Lastly, it can be used to create the light overcoat that makes a tank or train car appear to be sun faded. Soft Dirt is a medium brown color that can be used to show dirt in the treads of tanks, darker or heavier layers of dirt on rolling stock or wheelsets, general dirt on structures or vehicles, and even darker fleshtones.
<br><br>

Soft Dirt may be combined with Opaque Raw Sienna to create a more yellow mud hue. Fertile Soil is a sable dark brown color that can be used to show dirt in the tread or on the side of tanks. It also can be used to create the splash-back of dirt on the side of a building near the ground that occurs from rain. Fertile soil can be combined with Transparent Smoke to create a dark black-brown color that is ideal for creating skid marks from vehicles.
<br><br>

The Rusts<br>
Dark Rust is the darkest of rust colors that would be used to create the initial streak on an older rust streak or spot. It can be mixed with Light Rust and Opaque Raw Sienna to create intermediate colors or to change the hue. Dark Rust mixed with Transparent Smoke makes a nice grimy wash to create brake dust on vehicles or as an overall grimy wash on iron oxide rolling stock. Light Rust is the lighter component of the rust spectrum. It easily creates the stains that occur from water dripping across a heavily rusted spot. Opaque Raw Sienna is a wonderful color to create the fresh, bright yellow-orange rust spots on metals.
<br><br>

It also makes an excellent color to adjust any of the rust hues. The dirt colors also can be adjusted with the Raw Sienna to provide a more orange-yellow hue to the dirt.
<br><br>
The Smokes<br>
Blue-grey Smoke imitates the bluish-grey soot frequently seen on the end of cannons and guns from the black powder. It is also found on items that would have used anthracite or blue coal for energy. The soot from a steam locomotive traditionally has this blue-grey color. Additional uses include old industrial smoke stacks, roundhouses and tunnel portals, and even chimneys on structures. Transparent Smoke can be used for the standard smoke and soot on vehicles, structures and even scenery. In addition, it can be used as a base coat or a wash on figures to create the shadows in the folds of clothing or the relief on faces. Transparent Smoke also can be used to darken any of the colors in the palette. Old Oil combines yellows, browns, and blacks to create the characteristic color of old oil or dirty cup grease. It can be used on surfaces to create an oily, greasy or grungy appearance. This includes journal boxes on model train trucks or the tread mechanisms on tanks and armor. Old Oil can be lightened with Opaque White or Light Dust to create an aged concrete appearance that can be used throughout your scenery.<br><br>

Opaque White is excellent to use to lighten any of the colors in the palette. It also can be used to create the illusion of streaked white lettering on armor or rolling stock. Very light layers of Opaque White can be used to fade black lettering or to sun fade vehicles with a lighter base color.
<br><br>
Creating Rust Streaks<br>
Creating Rust Streaks tend to drip downward because gravity pulls the water down. Dripping rust spots can be created by using a pin or tiny brush to place a dab of Fertile Soil on your structure or vehicle where you want the rust spot. Let it dry for a minute or so and then place a dot of dark or light rust over it. Using a dry paintbrush, stroke LIGHTLY in a downward motion over the still-wet rust color. The result is a rust spot that has dirt and rust stains running down from it.
<br><br>
Three-Dimensional Weathering<br>
Three-dimensional rust, grease and dirt is easy to achieve with the
Real Deal Weathering Kit. Simply take a fine brush and dip it into the color of your choice. Then pick up a tiny amount of baking soda on your wet brush and placing it on the item.
<br><br>

Allow it to completely dry before adding any other colors to define the rust or dirt area. Seal the buildup in place with a dab of acrylic matte varnish. Sealing the weathering colors Once you are happy with your weathering, you may seal the paints in several ways. Matte or gloss acrylic varnishes may be lightly airbrushed over the item to seal the paint. Acrylic varnishes also can be mixed into the weathering paints to create permanence in a single-stage paint. This is particularly useful for creating the shiny appearance that oil or grease would have. Matte and gloss acrylic varnishes also can be mixed together to create varying degrees of a satin finish.<br><br><br>

Lighter shades can be made by adding Opaque White or Light Dust. Darker shades can be achieved by adding Transparent Smoke or even Fertile Soil. Enjoy experimenting and playing with mixing the colors.
<br><br>
Layers<br>

In addition to rapidly curing filler and coatings, the REVO Handheld is well suited for many other applications. It can be used for aluminum-body vehicle repair, dent removal, emblem and adhesive removal, bumper repair or softening glass seals.<p>

Increase Paint Shop Throughput - Not only does the REVO Handheld speed up your processes, it also allows painters to use higher-quality products and cure them faster, as opposed to using lower-quality, air dry products. Instead of having to wait for cure times and bounce between jobs, the REVO Handheld allows a technician to do one repair from start to finish before moving on to the next one. This significantly increases throughput and frees up space since you can complete the repair in one location.<p>

Quick Heating & Cooling Times - The REVO Handheld lamp reaches curing temperature in less than a second and cools down rapidly. The unit can be turned on only when needed and is safe to touch shortly after being turned off. Extended panels on the REVO Handheld allow the unit to be placed on the ground without damaging the lamp or burning the floor.<p>

Easy-to-Operate Controls - The REVO Handheld is extremely easy to use. There are no special power requirements; the unit simply plugs into any 110-volt outlet. The REVO Handheld turns on and off with a simple switch and is ready to use as soon as you turn it on. Lightweight and featuring an ergonomic handle, the REVO Handheld is easy to move around your shop.<p>

Expert Support & Service - REVO Systems are backed by Global Finishing Solutions for reliable service and support. Spare parts for all REVO models are readily available at GFS’ U.S. facility, and can be shipped overnight, decreasing costly downtime and eliminating the need to store backup parts. Visit GFS’ Center for Excellence training facility to see what REVO Systems have to offer before purchasing.<p>

Ergonomic Handle - REVO Handheld is lightweight and features an ergonomic handle, making it the ideal tool for rapidly curing filler, primer and clear coat.<p>"

Whether it’s a beefed-up V-8 or a lowered chop-top, a rockabilly ride or restored Model T, hot rods and custom cars drive the speed and style of car culture to a whole new plane. In a book that features some of the most beautiful rods and customs, author and photographer Bo Bertilsson burns film and rubber visiting events from Las Vegas to Paso Robles, chronicling the restoration of his own T-bucket, and offering an up-close look at rockabilly cars, including one owned by Jeff Beck. His book—with its vast cast of characters in their 20s and 30s, many embracing the culture right down to the hairstyles and clothes—offers head-turning testimony to a hot-rod and custom-car revival well underway.</br>",""

The F1 is our standard RZ Mask® filter with carbon filtration, consisting of two layers. The first layer is our highly effective particulate filter, trapping particles down to .1 micron in size. The second layer is an Active Carbon Element, which helps to reduce harmful fumes and odors. The best part? All RZ® filters have been laboratory tested to be up to 99.9% effective!<p>

FEATURES:<br>
+ Best-in-class filtration with 360-degree seal<br>
+ Active Carbon Element reduces odors<br>
+ Surpasses the N95 standard, filtering up to 99.9% of particulates down to .1 micron in size (400 times smaller than a human hair)!<br>
+ Independently tested at Nelson Laboratories in Salt Lake City, UT<br>
+ Performance far exceeds that of homemade masks, bandanas, cloth masks, and paper masks<p>

How long does an RZ Filter last? <br>
The life expectancy of the RZ Filter depends on many variables, such as; particulate exposure density, particulate exposure duration, and user breathing rate. With that said, below are our general guidelines – as the user will have the final call given your exposure.<p>

+ 20-30+ hours of continuous use in heavy dust/particulate exposure to things such as; painting, grain bins, off-roading, construction/demolition, etc.<p>

+ 30-40+ hours of continuous use in light dust exposure to things such as; painting, grain bins, off-roading, construction/demolition, etc.<p>

+ 50-60+ hours of continuous use when protecting against allergens, pollutants, odors, etc.</p>"

•The Advantages Of Working With Saral Wax Free Transfer Paper<br>
Saral Transfer Paper is wax free so it gives the advantage of erasing like pencil with no smear or smudge. It can be inked or painted over with no skipping or bleeding. The transfer lines can be sponged, washed out or brushed off of fabric, and a hot iron will not set them as will other tracing or transfer papers made for fabrics. Saral is economical and can be used again and again.<p>

•Saral Comes In 5 Colors<br>
Graphite: The all-purpose tracing medium. Excellent for illustration board and all drawing papers, wood, fabrics, canvas and metal.<p>

Red: Excellent for ceramics and china painting. The lines will fire out. Shows up equally well on light or dark surfaces and mixtures of the two, such as photographs and photostats. May be used on acetate overlays, plastics and enamel.<p>

Blue: Non-photographic. It's not necessary to clean off Saral blue when work goes before the platemaking camera. Ideal for key lines, mechanicals, paste-ups. For Tole Painters, it leaves a bright, easy to see transfer line.<p>

Yellow and White: For tracings on dark surfaces. Excellent on dark fabrics, dark wood, metal, as well as dark painting surfaces. Tole painters find white especially useful. Yellow is best for work on clear or stained glass.
<p>
Saral is Certified Non-Toxic<p>

All Saral transfer papers conform to ASTMD-4236 and are certified by The Art & Creative Materials Institute as non-toxic, so they are suitable for use by children, as well as adults.<p><p>"

      To make guns different from one another (i.e. guns for basecoat and guns for clearcoat), the gun can be marked by means of a coloured plastic disc (Colour Code System).
    <br>*
      Self-adjusting air and material packings with long life times considerably
      reduce servicing.
    <br>*
      The carefully polished nickel-plated gun surface reduces cleaning efforts
      as well.
    <br>*
      The infinitely variable round / flat spray control allows adapting the fan
      to all sorts of objects.
    <br>*
      Integrated air micrometer - helps you keep control over the Minijet just like a ""big"" one.
    <br>* The anti-drip device integrated into the cup lid (only with plastic cups) reliably prevents material from emerging from the vent and dripping onto the painted surface.

          <h3>Enhanced durability</h3>
          <p><span title=""Standard"">The spray gun body is  equipped with a corrosion-resistant chrome surface. The sturdy air cap  is made of chrome-plated brass; paint needle and fluid tip are made of  tempered stainless steel. The trigger protects the paint needle from  overspray during painting, thus prolonging the lifetime of the paint  needle sealing. The air piston rod has been especially reinforced. All  these features result in an extended spray gun lifetime.</span></p>
          <h3>Large QCC cup connection</h3>
          <p><span title=""Standard"">The SATAminijet 4400 B allows the use of all three RPS  cup sizes with no adapter necessary. Furthermore, the large connection  makes the cleaning of the material passages extremely safe and easy.</span></p>

<p>Designed by master pinstriping legend Steve Kafka, these brushes will unlock the mysteries of his style and enable to user to stripe curves as never before. These brushes turn corners with ease, flow striping enamels like no other brushes, and allow the user to do design work without the chance of “flare-out.” The sizes range from 0 through 6. They are all extremely versatile but could be considered specific relative to their size. The brushes are best used between 55 and 80 degrees to the surface of the work.<p>
All Kafka signature series pinstriping brushes can turn corners without “flare-out” and without the user “rolling the brush”— just lift and work the tip for designs that usually take years to master. Works equally well with urethanes and oil-based enamels. Made by master brush makers to last and perform longer than any brush ... ever.<p>

Striper, Size 0 - The size 0 brush is the smallest available. It's capable of turning very tight corners and very fine design work while still maintaining great line consistency due to the nature of design and combination of synthetic and natural hair.<p>

Striper, Size 1 - The size 1 is slightly larger than the 0 and will perform the same as the 0 with a slightly heavier line. As with all the Kafka brushes, they perform with oil-based enamels as well as urethane striping paint.
<p>
Striper, Size 3 - The size 3 will work in a wide variety of applications from scroll striping to shorter, long-line designs. This brush will give the user greater control in all applications and flatten the learning curve for novice stripers. The size 3 is also the most used favorite of its designer, Steve Kafka.
<p>
Striper, Size 5 - The size 5, which is slightly larger than the size 3, holds more paint and will accomplish heavier designs with ease. Depending on pressure, the line thickness can reach 1/4"" and fine lines to 1/16"" in the other direction. This brush is a favorite for outlining larger flame layouts, cars, trucks, and semi trucks.
<p>
Striper, Size 6 - The size 6 will give you the heavier lines needed in many instances, but still can deliver delicate design work. It's used for initial layouts followed by smaller sizes for more delicate additions in beautiful combinations.</p>"

        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>What is SharpenAir™?</li>
      </ul>
        <blockquote>        SharpenAir™ is a hand-held tool designed to repair bent and damage airbrush fluid needles. <br>
          <br>
        </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>How does it work?</li>
      </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>The  design is compact and easy-to-use. SharpenAir™ utilizes multiple angles  allowing your damaged needle to be straightened precisely and correctly  each and every time while maintaining its factory angle. There are four  runners located at the bottom of each SharpenAir™ which are uniquely  angled to do the work for you. At the end of each runner is a  diamond-grit coated sharpening stone. These stones are made up of  varying grit and work together to provide you with a consistently  perfect finish. <br>
          </blockquote>
</blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>How long does the sharpening process take?</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>The process typically takes 1-5 minutes depending on the severity of the bend in your needle. </blockquote>
          <blockquote><br>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Is it compatible with multiple needle sizes and brands?</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>Yes.  SharpenAir™ was designed to work as a universal tool. It is compatible  with most fluid needle sizes and brands. However, the DeVilbiss Dagr and certain Paschae  models may need some modifications to the SharpenAir due to needle  shaft thickness. We do offer these custom modifications (PLEASE CALL). Through research we've discovered that most needles, no matter  the size, were ground at the same angle. The difference in needle sizes  is attributed to the length of the cone rather than the angle at which  it is made. SharpenAir™ controls the angle while it sharpens allowing  you to efficiently and effortlessly correct bent needles to their  factory finish. </blockquote>
          <blockquote><br>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Will it affect the factory angle of my airbrush needle?</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>No. You can be confident that SharpenAir™ will give you a precise factory angle with every use. </blockquote>
          <blockquote><br>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>How can SharpenAir™ save me money?</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>By  using  SharpenAir™ you will dramatically cut costs by not having to pay for  pricey needle replacements; we give you the ability to extend the life  of your airbrush needles. SharpenAir™ will not only save you money, but  will save you time as well. Keeping your projects on schedule is an  important part of keeping customers happy. </blockquote>

          <blockquote>SharpenAir™ is made with high-quality materials to enhance durability and  function. The design also allows users to get the most use out of every  component.

<p>The Iwata Silver Jet compressor proves ideal for the hobbyist or professional user who wants a small, reliable source of air in an attractive and feature-rich design. The Silver Jet's quiet and compact size makes it ideal for use in small work spaces and quick set ups. It will power most gravity feed airbrushes for low pressure applications of around 1 to 18 PSI. <p>

This compressor is simple to operate and requires zero maintenance providing easy, reliable air when you need it. The air regulator knob allows you to adjust the working pressure and the gauge reflects an accurate psi reading, so you can fine tune your airflow for your airbrush and project. The built-in airbrush holder provides a safe and convenient place to rest your airbrush when you are not spraying. When you have finished your spray session the built-in cord wrap makes for easy storage. <p>

Includes a durable polyurethane cobra coil airbrush hose for Iwata airbrushes. Also included are air hose adaptors for Badger, Aztek and Paasche brand airbrushes and a detailed operation manual. </p>

Eliminate fisheyes and other imperfections on the surface of automobile panels with the Marson Smoothie II Fish Eye Eliminator when used with solvent based paints.

In this special step-by-step presentation, the legendary Sorayama guides you from sketch to completion revealing his secrets of painting along the way. As you watch this DVD it’s important to note Sorayama’s careful planning and composition of an image, his meticulous attention to the smallest details, his painstaking development of and continuous interaction with a painting, how he pays close attention to his reference, and his versatile use and array of mixed media. Sorayama approaches his paintings interactively. In other words, instead of simply executing a painting, he works methodically, allowing visual feedback to guide him as he progresses. He switches tools often as he gradually builds his surfaces, and he doesn't attempt to complete any one section in the first few passes, but rather starts light and gradually incorporates paint, ink, pencil, and airbrush until he’s satisfied. World renowned illustrator Dru Blair is your guide throughout Sorayama’s masterful rendering of an exotic pin-up. To see more of Sorayama’s art, visit www.sorayama.net.  <p><font color=""#ffffff"">NOT SUBJECT TO QUANTITY DISCOUNT</font>","In this DVD, you’ll learn: • Use of technical pens, paintbrushes, airbrush, and a variety of pencils • Use of razor knives • How to transfer your image to an illustration board • Use of an Artograph opaque projector • Use of a compass • How to mix flesh-tones • How to build texture • How to render shading and half-tones • Use of acrylic colors • How to apply a wash • Blending techniques • How to use yourself as reference for an image • How to eliminate unwanted blemishes from a painting • Use of spray fixative • How to prevent your illustration board from warping • How to use electric and pencil erasers for highlights • How to accelerate drying between coats • How to achieve perfectly straight lines with a paintbrush • Use of frisket and masking And much more!"

It was during that time--on four consecutive Sundays in 1970--that Richard Karl Koch visited Von Dutch in his Calabasas, California, home to photograph the father of modern pinstriping and soul of the hot rod movement for a cover story for the Los Angeles Times Sunday supplement, West magazine. Koch's candid and colorful photographs from those shoots, the vast majority published here for the first time, provide a window on Von Dutch's missing years. Here we see the enigmatic icon in his many guises, from cantankerous genius to freewheeling goof, machining handgun parts in his famous workshop/bus, casually clowning with vehicles left at his home by his friend Steve McQueen (including the car Von Dutch built for McQueen's 1969 film, The Reivers), and working at the pinstriping that sealed his fame as an original American artist. Accompanied by captions that bring to light further facets of this period of Von Dutch's life and career, these photographs illustrate a little-known and largely fascinating chapter of hot rod history. A must for any serious hot rod collection."

If you want to clear over Brush FX, go right ahead. This is the ONLY striping paint on the market that can be cleared without worry of wrinkling or recoat sensitivity issues. No need for tack coats, longer flash times, and hoping and praying as you clear. Finally a worry free striping paint when it comes to clearing! If you do not wish to clear Brush FX, we have you covered there too. Simply pallet with 7603/7605/7607 hardener, and you now have a catalyzed, fully UV backed striping and lettering paint that will not fade or fail in the sun or elements. If you want a scientific mixing ratio, mix it 8:1 with our 76 series hardener. Adding hardener, will also help the way it flows, and most find reducer is not needed.<p>

Another plus with Brush FX is dry times! Literally have a striping paint that is dry in anywhere from 5-10 minutes. You can stripe another color right over it, and it will not move or bleed on you. Try that with the enamels on the market.<p>
Want coverage on your white? Its called 1 Coat white for a reason. No 2 coats here. Something Brush FX does offer, is pretty impressive coverage ability.

<p>You guessed it: Craig Fraser has been at it again! This time it is not a skull, texture or iconic theme... it is the Artool® Freehand® Airbrush Template “H” StencilTM!<br><br>
“The “H” StencilTM is a simple French-curve design that can help any artist improve their Artool® Freehand® Shield skills when airbrushing fire, smoke, dragon scales and any number of effects your imagination can conjure up. A huge advantage of the “H” StencilTM is its specific one-handed design. By using one hand you can not only manipulate where you place the stencil, you can also change the shape of it by squeezing it together to morph an outlining edge. The outside radius on the three major legs perfectly match each internal radius, which allows the artist to create positive and negative curves such as the “inclusions” inside realistic fire and the negative space needed when rendering wisps of smoke. The gradual long curves also allow you to use the “H” part of your stencil to help shield and airbrush drop shadows on curved graphics and flames - without having to mask them off. Since it is often necessary to airbrush
in different scales, the Artool® “H” StencilTM is produced in two sizes. Do not let the simplicity of the “H” StencilTM fool you. Remember the quote: “Less is more!” You will be surprised with the complex images you can create and complete with the simplicity of the “H” StencilTM. Good luck and let me know the various uses you find for this mylar beauty — it has become one of my favorite all-time Artool® Stencils. Keep an eye out for my upcoming articles and videos on its use!”<br><br>",""

Whatever the vehicle--from classic hot rod to pick-up to chopper--a custom paint job sets it apart. But not all paint jobs are created equal, so how can you tell which style, technique, or scheme will suit the unique demands of your vehicle and budget? Before making a big investment--whether youre hiring a painter or doing the job yourself--turn to this book for a clear idea of what works and what doesnt. Drawing on years of experience running her own custom painting shop, JoAnn Bortles reviews the full array of options for paints, graphics, and effects. In an easygoing and engaging manner, and with photographs to illustrate her points, she explains the tools and techniques that apply in various paint schemes and shows what might work especially well in certain situations and for particular vehicles. Whether youre looking for inspiration, considering color combinations or graphics, or simply wondering what to look for in a local paint shop, this book will answer your questions--and help you get the custom paint job thats perfect for you.",""

When the two Grumbacher stripers were no longer offered we found the company who had been making these for Grumbacher and began offering the same brush, but with our name on the handle.  Unfortunately that manufacturing company went out of business in mid 2002 and we assume the assets were purchased by a company in India.  We were concerned about quality, distance, exchange rates etc., so we worked with several ""Grumbacher users"" and developed our own version of the old Grumbacher 1010.  We can not offer the 1020 black plastic handle, since we would have to buy too many handles to get a cost effective price.  Stripers who worked with us to develop this new brush also suggested that it be a bit longer.",""

About the Artist<br>

Terry ‘Kiwi’ Stephens started airbrushing at the age of 16 as a hobby, painted professionally in his native New Zealand for a couple of years, and came to the U.S. in 1999 (“the hub of airbrushing and all things custom”) to work for Huntington Beach Bodyworks. Stephens is also a hired gun helping other shops and artists with their projects. Most recently, Terry is working on a series of paintings for future availability in print, and enjoys teaching as a new instructor for the esteemed Airbrush Getaway workshops."

Since all of the TRIBALNOMETRY™ shapes are linear they can be either applied to long 'n straight(er) areas, OR you can curve them around bike tanks, fenders and/or other irregularly shaped surfaces for masking out various tribal styles and create tribal bands to infinity! Plus, you'll be able to concoct more symmetrical centerpieces with your TRIBAL MASTERS™ than you'll know what to do with!</p><br><p>CIRQUE DU TRIBLE'™<br>

The CIRQUE DU TRIBLE'™ shapes work perfectly for a myriad of background images. Whichever one of the TRIBLE'™ shapes you use, they are great for shading or for creating extremely intricate symmetrical themes. Here are a couple of HOT tips: ghosting effects are incredibly kewl when used with pearl finishes, and you can achieve some radically prominent effects when spraying opaque or metallic layers. Other uses include layout applications and creating designs you can easily cut out with an art knife.</p>",""

We are having great success with this synthetic sable hair which is also used in Von Dago’s Mini Saber and Saber Liner series.  Let’s look at what the artist has to say about this brush.<p>

“Using my favorite synthetic hair in this brush for longevity, it’s only a mere 3/4&#8243; out from the Ferrule. Whether it be on canvas art or vehicles, I like to personally sign my name to look like a stamp, time after time, so the public – and my peers – can easily tell who striped the car they are admiring, whether it be displayed at a car show or parked in a parking lot.<p>

I designed this brush solely for this purpose – for absolute consistency over ‘n over ‘n over! Plus, if you strictly use it for what it’s intended for, it should last you at least a couple of years.<p>

Now we all know you can sign a name with any type of brush, but once again – and speaking only for myself – I want absolute no stress and no hassle consistency.<p>

I want people to be able to read my name, not guess at it, you know?” – Von Dago<p>

This series is a full synthetic filament mixture.<p>"

• W358 Gold Plating is T6 aircraft-grade aluminum with a golden yellow coating.  It creates a highly reflective metallic gold without a pearlized or textured finish.  <br>

• Do not reduce. Spray directly from the bottle around 25 psi inlet. 4105 gold has excellent adhesion direct to any surface and can be applied direct to glossy, non-sanded surfaces such as powder-coat, urethane finishes, plastics, and any substrate.<br>

• Apply over a gloss white base for the most vivid, billet gold. Or apply over a gloss black base for a deep, orange-shade gold. *May be applied to non gloss colors, but gloss achieves most reflective results.<br>

• Apply W358 Gold in very, very light coats. It’s essential that some of the black base be visible through W358 Gold. It cannot be stressed enough how light this must be applied; too much and the brilliant Gold effect is lost.<br>

<p>
Pearl-flakes may also be mixed with candy2o to make candied pearl colors that are deep and vibrant.
<p>
<font color=""white"">Pearl Flake Series</font>
<p>
• Hot Rod Sparkle, large pearl-flakes that create a coarse effect. Apply with a 0.5mm or larger tip-size airbrush.<br>
W420 HRS White is a transparent flake that mixes and color-keys well with any color.<br>
• Cosmic Sparkle, small, 8-sided crystal pearls that create a more refined pearl effect compared to Hot Rod Sparkle.<br>
Cosmic Sparkle are automotive OEM, Xiralliac pearls. Spray through a 0.5mm and a 0.3mm airbrush tip-size tip with thinning with 4011 Reducer ~ 10 – 20% per volume.<br>
• Hi-Lite Interference, accent pearls with a soft effect. Very similar to the shimmering effect of pearlescent fish scale
<p> <p>

• Extend with 4004 Transparent Base, 4050 or 4030, then thin with 4011 Reducer 5% – 10% per vol.
• Apply over metallic colors for added glow, for example W 404 Hi-Lite Blue over 6013 Silver Sealer.
