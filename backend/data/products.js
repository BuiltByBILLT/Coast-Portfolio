    "pDescription": "Pinstriping is the signature art of Kustom Kulture,and the purest expression of a customizer's style. Pinstripe Planet, authored by one of the art's most respected practitioners, is a photographic and textual celebration of this unique decorative art form, a genuine instance of motor-Americana now making its mark around the globe. A historical and visual overview of pinstriping culture, the book takes readers into all the great shops - from Circle City Hot Rods and Baron Speed Shop to Romance of Rust and The Paintbox - and right into the action as a variety of rides ranging from hot rods and lowriders to old-school choppers and bobbers are striped up. Today's influential contemporaries are featured, such as Art Schilling, Jimmy C, Steve Chazyeka, and Herb Martinez in the United States; Tom Plate, John Leeson and Neil Meillard in Europe; Makoto Kobayashi in Japan; and Simon Watts in Australia.",

When spraying straight from the bottle with out thinning your paint add one or 2 drops and adjust your PSI accordingly. You can pull ultra fine lines. Figure painters add a drop for slower blending. Adding too much polyurethane  will cause the paint to dry much slower. Do not add Poly to the Mission Models Primer.

Growing up in the 1970�s and 1980�s, Davis�s main influences came from Heavy Metal, Creepy, Eerie, andThrasher Skateboarding magazines, and The Savage Sword of Conan art. �My sense of proportion and dynamic lighting came from trying to emulate great artists such as Richard Corben, Bernie Wrightson, Tim Vigil, and Pushead. I always admired how they could use dark subject matter to convey emotion and a sense of presence and tension. For me the most profound and fun part of the whole artistic process is when you get to that place where the painting tells you what it wants, and you�re just adding color and keeping the gun moving.�"

Constructed of durable stainless steel and extruded aluminum, these light boxes offer a comfortably slanted 16\" x 18\" (41 x 46 cm) surface for more convenient viewing and tracing. The translucent surface is flush-mounted for a clean and completely unobstructed flat work surface. Accurate 90 degree edges offer precise reference for measuring and attaching T-squares. The near-perfect illumination is created by the combination of 5000K fluorescent lamps and a specially designed polyester pearlescent reflector system. The result is a brilliant viewing window that is free of hot spots or shadows. Unlike any other light box, these new light boxes feature a unique front storage compartment that is cleverly hidden under the rounded wrist rest. Pencils, pens, embossing stylus, rulers and many other tools can be stored for easy access.

Illustration  Colors offer true fine-line, detailed performance while allowing for  re-wettable effects and subtle erasing techniques.  As the name implies,  Illustration Colors are designed with the illustrator and fine artist  in mind without catering to the demand for high coverage base colors.<br>\n          <br>\n          Illustration Colors are lightfast.  We use the same exterior-grade  pigments we use to make our Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors.  The  difference is in the resin.  Unlike Wicked Colors and Auto Air Colors  which air dry to a cured, non-soluble coating, Illustration Colors are  re-wettable with an amine such as Windex�.  This is one of the key  characteristics behind the creation of our Illustration Colors.  Another  key characteristic this resin offers is subtle erasing.  Illustration  Colors are very easy to erase compared to our resilient Wicked Colors <br>\n          <br>\n        No reduction necessary.  Illustration Colors atomize and spray excellent  through small airbrush tip sizes down to 0.15mm at low psi settings  straight out of the bottle.  Unlike Wicked Colors, Wicked Detail Colors  and Auto Air Colors which are intended for application with a spray gun  direct from the bottle, Illustration Colors are intended solely for  application with an airbrush and are not designed to cover as a base  color.  Reducer and Transparent Base is offered in our Illustration  Colors line for artists wishing to make colors even thinner or more  transparent based upon subjective preferences, however, most artist will  find performance is excellent straight out of the bottle.</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>"

    "pLongDescription": "HOW THE COM-ART COLOURS WORK<br><br>\n\nThe Browns<br>\n\nOpaque Raw Umber can be used for medium brown colored bark on trees as well as patches of dirt, or to simulate a dirt road or footpaths. Lastly, it can be used, sparingly, to make the leaves on plants appear to be dead or sun stressed. Raw Umber may be combined with Opaque Iron Yellow to create a more yellow-orange mud hue or to create late fall foliage.<br><br>\n\nOpaque Burnt Umber is the dark brown colour that can be used to create the dark bark on trees, stumps and plants as well as dirt buildup on rocks and crevices. Burnt Umber also can be sprayed on groundfoam and scenery to create exposed patches of dirt in fields, lawns, freight yards and industrial areas. Both burnt and Raw Umber can be airbrushed on the leafy areas of trees to give the appearance of winter �dead� vegetation.<br><br>\n\nThe Greens\n<br>\nThe Real Deal Scenery Kit contains two shades of Green. The two colours can be combined and intermixed with the yellows or even blue to create a wide variety of intermediate shades of green for plants, tree leaves, weeds and grasses. Using a variety of shades and colours give a more realistic appearance than a single colour of ground foam.<br><br>\n\nOpaque Sap Green is the brighter of the greens in the set. By itself, it can create the late spring/early summer leaves and plants. It can be mixed with Transparent Black or Opaque Raw or Burnt Umber to change the hue for late summer or fall vegetation.<br><br>\n\nThe Yellows<br>\n\nOpaque Iron Yellow is a wonderful colour to create sun-burned grass, the leaves on Aspen trees, and fall leaves. It also makes an excellent colour to adjust any of the rust hues. The dirt colours also can be adjusted with the Raw Sienna to provide a more orange/yellow hue to dirt.<br><br>\n\nOpaque Deep Yellow is the colour of choice to create bright yellow flowers such as dandelions or daffodils. Deep Yellow can be used to make the bright yellow leaves of Aspen trees and bright fall foliage. Bright orange hues can be created by adding in tiny amounts of Toluedene Red.<br><br><br>\n\n<i>Tips and Techniques by Leslie Eaton</i>\n<br><br>\nShake Well<br>\n\nThese scenery colors are comprised of many different pigments, some heavier than others. The pigments may separate into layers in the bottle while sitting so be sure to shake the bottle well before using and periodically while using. You may want to use a soft paint brush to stir the paint from the sides and bottom of the bottle.<br><br>\n\nExperiment<br>\n\nThese colors are designed to be intermixed to create intermediate hues allowing you to have colors that are unique as the scenery you are creating. Lighter shades can be made by adding Opaque White. Darker shades can be achieved by adding Transparent Black or even Opaque Burnt Umber. Enjoy experimenting and playing with mixing the colors.<br><br>\n\nLayers<br>\n\nAdd soft color changes to your scenery using numerous light layers of color. This will allow you to achieve the natural, subtle changes that are seen in nature and help you to avoid having leopard-spotted landscapes. Applying fine layers of different colors also allows you to achieve the most realistic appearance to your scenery. <br><br>"

    "pLongDescription": "HOW THE COM-ART COLOURS WORK<br><br>\n\nThe Browns<br>\nLight Dust can be used for very light shades of dirt or ballast, or to simulate a light coat of very fine dirt. It also can be used to make the white or off-white lettering in signs, model train cars, or armor to appear to be streaking. Lastly, it can be used to create the light overcoat that makes a tank or train car appear to be sun faded. Soft Dirt is a medium brown color that can be used to show dirt in the treads of tanks, darker or heavier layers of dirt on rolling stock or wheelsets, general dirt on structures or vehicles, and even darker fleshtones.\n<br><br>\n\nSoft Dirt may be combined with Opaque Raw Sienna to create a more yellow mud hue. Fertile Soil is a sable dark brown color that can be used to show dirt in the tread or on the side of tanks. It also can be used to create the splash-back of dirt on the side of a building near the ground that occurs from rain. Fertile soil can be combined with Transparent Smoke to create a dark black-brown color that is ideal for creating skid marks from vehicles.\n<br><br>\n\nThe Rusts<br>\nDark Rust is the darkest of rust colors that would be used to create the initial streak on an older rust streak or spot. It can be mixed with Light Rust and Opaque Raw Sienna to create intermediate colors or to change the hue. Dark Rust mixed with Transparent Smoke makes a nice grimy wash to create brake dust on vehicles or as an overall grimy wash on iron oxide rolling stock. Light Rust is the lighter component of the rust spectrum. It easily creates the stains that occur from water dripping across a heavily rusted spot. Opaque Raw Sienna is a wonderful color to create the fresh, bright yellow-orange rust spots on metals.\n<br><br>\n\nIt also makes an excellent color to adjust any of the rust hues. The dirt colors also can be adjusted with the Raw Sienna to provide a more orange-yellow hue to the dirt.\n<br><br>\nThe Smokes<br>\nBlue-grey Smoke imitates the bluish-grey soot frequently seen on the end of cannons and guns from the black powder. It is also found on items that would have used anthracite or blue coal for energy. The soot from a steam locomotive traditionally has this blue-grey color. Additional uses include old industrial smoke stacks, roundhouses and tunnel portals, and even chimneys on structures. Transparent Smoke can be used for the standard smoke and soot on vehicles, structures and even scenery. In addition, it can be used as a base coat or a wash on figures to create the shadows in the folds of clothing or the relief on faces. Transparent Smoke also can be used to darken any of the colors in the palette. Old Oil combines yellows, browns, and blacks to create the characteristic color of old oil or dirty cup grease. It can be used on surfaces to create an oily, greasy or grungy appearance. This includes journal boxes on model train trucks or the tread mechanisms on tanks and armor. Old Oil can be lightened with Opaque White or Light Dust to create an aged concrete appearance that can be used throughout your scenery.<br><br>\n\nOpaque White is excellent to use to lighten any of the colors in the palette. It also can be used to create the illusion of streaked white lettering on armor or rolling stock. Very light layers of Opaque White can be used to fade black lettering or to sun fade vehicles with a lighter base color.\n<br><br>\nCreating Rust Streaks<br>\nCreating Rust Streaks tend to drip downward because gravity pulls the water down. Dripping rust spots can be created by using a pin or tiny brush to place a dab of Fertile Soil on your structure or vehicle where you want the rust spot. Let it dry for a minute or so and then place a dot of dark or light rust over it. Using a dry paintbrush, stroke LIGHTLY in a downward motion over the still-wet rust color. The result is a rust spot that has dirt and rust stains running down from it.\n<br><br>\nThree-Dimensional Weathering<br>\nThree-dimensional rust, grease and dirt is easy to achieve with the\nReal Deal Weathering Kit. Simply take a fine brush and dip it into the color of your choice. Then pick up a tiny amount of baking soda on your wet brush and placing it on the item.\n<br><br>\n\nAllow it to completely dry before adding any other colors to define the rust or dirt area. Seal the buildup in place with a dab of acrylic matte varnish. Sealing the weathering colors Once you are happy with your weathering, you may seal the paints in several ways. Matte or gloss acrylic varnishes may be lightly airbrushed over the item to seal the paint. Acrylic varnishes also can be mixed into the weathering paints to create permanence in a single-stage paint. This is particularly useful for creating the shiny appearance that oil or grease would have. Matte and gloss acrylic varnishes also can be mixed together to create varying degrees of a satin finish.<br><br><br>\n\n<i>Tips and Techniques by Leslie Eaton</i>\n<br><br>\nShake Well<br>\nThese weathering colors are comprised of many different pigments, some heavier than others. The pigments may separate into layers in the bottle while sitting so be sure to shake the bottle well before using and periodically while using. You may want to use a soft paint brush to stir the paint from the sides and bottom of the bottle.\n<br><br>\nExperiment<br>\nThese colors are designed to be intermixed to create intermediate hues allowing you to have colors that are unique to the item you are weathering. Lighter shades can be made by adding Opaque White or Light Dust. Darker shades can be achieved by adding Transparent Smoke or even Fertile Soil. Enjoy experimenting and playing with mixing the colors.\n<br><br>\nLayers<br>\nApply your weathering using numerous light layers of color. This will allow you to achieve a greater depth of color and help you to avoid applying too much weathering. Applying layers of diff erent colors also allows you to achieve the most realistic appearance to your models.<br><br>"

It can be used for aluminum-body vehicle repair, dent removal, emblem and adhesive removal, bumper repair or softening glass seals.<p>\n\nIncrease Paint Shop Throughput - Not only does the REVO Handheld speed up your processes, it also allows painters to use higher-quality products and cure them faster, as opposed to using lower-quality, air dry products. Instead of having to wait for cure times and bounce between jobs, the REVO Handheld allows a technician to do one repair from start to finish before moving on to the next one. This significantly increases throughput and frees up space since you can complete the repair in one location.<p>\n\nQuick Heating & Cooling Times - The REVO Handheld lamp reaches curing temperature in less than a second and cools down rapidly. The unit can be turned on only when needed and is safe to touch shortly after being turned off. Extended panels on the REVO Handheld allow the unit to be placed on the ground without damaging the lamp or burning the floor.<p>\n\nEasy-to-Operate Controls - The REVO Handheld is extremely easy to use. There are no special power requirements; the unit simply plugs into any 110-volt outlet. The REVO Handheld turns on and off with a simple switch and is ready to use as soon as you turn it on. Lightweight and featuring an ergonomic handle, the REVO Handheld is easy to move around your shop.<p>\n\nExpert Support & Service - REVO Systems are backed by Global Finishing Solutions for reliable service and support. Spare parts for all REVO models are readily available at GFS� U.S. facility, and can be shipped overnight, decreasing costly downtime and eliminating the need to store backup parts. Visit GFS� Center for Excellence training facility to see what REVO Systems have to offer before purchasing.<p>\n\nErgonomic Handle - REVO Handheld is lightweight and features an ergonomic handle, making it the ideal tool for rapidly curing filler, primer and clear coat.<p>"

    "pDescription": "by Bo Bertilsson<br>\nWhether it�s a beefed-up V-8 or a lowered chop-top, a rockabilly ride or restored Model T, hot rods and custom cars drive the speed and style of car culture to a whole new plane. In a book that features some of the most beautiful rods and customs, author and photographer Bo Bertilsson burns film and rubber visiting events from Las Vegas to Paso Robles, chronicling the restoration of his own T-bucket, and offering an up-close look at rockabilly cars, including one owned by Jeff Beck. His book�with its vast cast of characters in their 20s and 30s, many embracing the culture right down to the hairstyles and clothes�offers head-turning testimony to a hot-rod and custom-car revival well underway.</br>",

It makes clean, crisp tracings that can be erased and painted over.</p><p>\n\n\n�The Advantages Of Working With Saral Wax Free Transfer Paper<br>\nSaral Transfer Paper is wax free so it gives the advantage of erasing like pencil with no smear or smudge. It can be inked or painted over with no skipping or bleeding. The transfer lines can be sponged, washed out or brushed off of fabric, and a hot iron will not set them as will other tracing or transfer papers made for fabrics. Saral is economical and can be used again and again.<p>\n\n�Saral Comes In 5 Colors<br>\nGraphite: The all-purpose tracing medium. Excellent for illustration board and all drawing papers, wood, fabrics, canvas and metal.<p>\n\nRed: Excellent for ceramics and china painting. The lines will fire out. Shows up equally well on light or dark surfaces and mixtures of the two, such as photographs and photostats. May be used on acetate overlays, plastics and enamel.<p>\n\nBlue: Non-photographic. It's not necessary to clean off Saral blue when work goes before the platemaking camera. Ideal for key lines, mechanicals, paste-ups. For Tole Painters, it leaves a bright, easy to see transfer line.<p>\n\nYellow and White: For tracings on dark surfaces. Excellent on dark fabrics, dark wood, metal, as well as dark painting surfaces. Tole painters find white especially useful. Yellow is best for work on clear or stained glass.\n<p>\nSaral is Certified Non-Toxic<p>\n\nAll Saral transfer papers conform to ASTMD-4236 and are certified by The Art & Creative Materials Institute as non-toxic, so they are suitable for use by children, as well as adults.<p><p>"

SharpenAir� utilizes multiple angles  allowing your damaged needle to be straightened precisely and correctly  each and every time while maintaining its factory angle. There are four  runners located at the bottom of each SharpenAir� which are uniquely  angled to do the work for you. At the end of each runner is a  diamond-grit coated sharpening stone. These stones are made up of  varying grit and work together to provide you with a consistently  perfect finish.�<br>\n          </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How long does the sharpening process take?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <blockquote>\n          <blockquote>The process typically takes 1-5 minutes depending on the severity of the bend in your needle.�</blockquote>\n          <blockquote><br>\n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Is it compatible with multiple needle sizes and brands?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <blockquote>\n          <blockquote>Yes.  SharpenAir� was designed to work as a universal tool. It is compatible  with most fluid needle sizes and brands. However, the DeVilbiss Dagr and certain Paschae  models may need some modifications to the SharpenAir due to needle  shaft thickness. We do offer these custom modifications (PLEASE CALL). Through research we've discovered that most needles, no matter  the size, were ground at the same angle. The difference in needle sizes  is attributed to the length of the cone rather than the angle at which  it is made. SharpenAir� controls the angle while it sharpens allowing  you to efficiently and effortlessly correct bent needles to their  factory finish.�</blockquote>\n          <blockquote><br>\n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Will it affect the factory angle of my airbrush needle?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <blockquote>\n          <blockquote>No. You can be confident that SharpenAir� will give you a precise factory angle with every use.�</blockquote>\n          <blockquote><br>\n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n        <ul>\n          <li>How can SharpenAir� save me money?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <blockquote>\n          <blockquote>By  using  SharpenAir� you will dramatically cut costs by not having to pay for  pricey needle replacements; we give you the ability to extend the life  of your airbrush needles. SharpenAir� will not only save you money, but  will save you time as well. Keeping your projects on schedule is an  important part of keeping customers happy. </blockquote>\n          <blockquote><br>\n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n        <ul>\n          <li>What is the life-span of SharpenAir�?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <blockquote>\n          <blockquote>SharpenAir� is made with high-quality materials to enhance durability and  function.

    "pLongDescription": "<p>The Iwata Silver Jet compressor proves ideal for the hobbyist or professional user who wants a small, reliable source of air in an attractive and feature-rich design. The Silver Jet's quiet and compact size makes it ideal for use in small work spaces and quick set ups. It will power most gravity feed airbrushes for low pressure applications of around 1 to 18 PSI. <p>\n\nThis compressor is simple to operate and requires zero maintenance providing easy, reliable air when you need it. The air regulator knob allows you to adjust the working pressure and the gauge reflects an accurate psi reading, so you can fine tune your airflow for your airbrush and project. The built-in airbrush holder provides a safe and convenient place to rest your airbrush when you are not spraying. When you have finished your spray session the built-in cord wrap makes for easy storage. <p>\n\nIncludes a durable polyurethane cobra coil airbrush hose for Iwata airbrushes. Also included are air hose adaptors for Badger, Aztek and Paasche brand airbrushes and a detailed operation manual. </p>\n<br><br>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"203\"><strong>Pressure Category</strong></td>\n      <td width=\"105\">Low</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Voltage Requirement (V)</strong></td>\n      <td>110 - 120V 60 Hz</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Plug Type</strong></td>\n      <td>B</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Approved Region</strong></td>\n      <td>North America</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Amps (A)</strong></td>\n      <td>2.30</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Wattage (W)</strong></td>\n      <td>145</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Horsepower (hp)</strong></td>\n      <td>1/10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Air Flow @ 60 Hz (CFM)</strong></td>\n      <td>0.32</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Air Flow @ 60 Hz (LPM)</strong></td>\n      <td>9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Max Pressure (psi)</strong></td>\n      <td>55</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Max Pressure (MPa)</strong></td>\n      <td>0.38</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Working Pressure (psi)</strong></td>\n      <td>1 - 18</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Working Pressure (MPa)</strong></td>\n      <td>0.01 - .12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Auto-Shut-off</strong></td>\n      <td>No</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Air Pressure Regulator</strong></td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Net Weight (lbs)</strong></td>\n      <td>3.01</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Net Weight (kg)</strong></td>\n      <td>6.64</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Assembled Dimensions (in)</strong></td>\n      <td>6.10 x 6.10 x 6.89</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Assembled Dimensions (mm)</strong></td>\n      <td>155 x 155 x 175</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"

    "pDescription": "This is an exceptionally rare and exclusive opportunity to witness the creation of a painting by Sorayama, one of the greatest living illustrators of our time, and perhaps in history. In this special step-by-step presentation, the legendary Sorayama guides you from sketch to completion revealing his secrets of painting along the way. As you watch this DVD it�s important to note Sorayama�s careful planning and composition of an image, his meticulous attention to the smallest details, his painstaking development of and continuous interaction with a painting, how he pays close attention to his reference, and his versatile use and array of mixed media. Sorayama approaches his paintings interactively. In other words, instead of simply executing a painting, he works methodically, allowing visual feedback to guide him as he progresses. He switches tools often as he gradually builds his surfaces, and he doesn't attempt to complete any one section in the first few passes, but rather starts light and gradually incorporates paint, ink, pencil, and airbrush until he�s satisfied. World renowned illustrator Dru Blair is your guide throughout Sorayama�s masterful rendering of an exotic pin-up. To see more of Sorayama�s art, visit www.sorayama.net.  <p><font color=\"#ffffff\">NOT SUBJECT TO QUANTITY DISCOUNT</font>",
    "pLongDescription": "In this DVD, you�ll learn: � Use of technical pens, paintbrushes, airbrush, and a variety of pencils � Use of razor knives � How to transfer your image to an illustration board � Use of an Artograph opaque projector � Use of a compass � How to mix flesh-tones � How to build texture � How to render shading and half-tones � Use of acrylic colors � How to apply a wash � Blending techniques � How to use yourself as reference for an image � How to eliminate unwanted blemishes from a painting � Use of spray fixative � How to prevent your illustration board from warping � How to use electric and pencil erasers for highlights � How to accelerate drying between coats � How to achieve perfectly straight lines with a paintbrush � Use of frisket and masking And much more!"

    "pLongDescription": "A famously crazed presence in the hot rod movement of the 1950s, rediscovered in the 1980s when 50s nostalgia swept pop culture, Kenneth \"Von Dutch\" Howard spent more than a decade essentially missing-in-action from the scene he had helped to create and define. It was during that time--on four consecutive Sundays in 1970--that Richard Karl Koch visited Von Dutch in his Calabasas, California, home to photograph the father of modern pinstriping and soul of the hot rod movement for a cover story for the Los Angeles Times Sunday supplement, West magazine. Koch's candid and colorful photographs from those shoots, the vast majority published here for the first time, provide a window on Von Dutch's missing years. Here we see the enigmatic icon in his many guises, from cantankerous genius to freewheeling goof, machining handgun parts in his famous workshop/bus, casually clowning with vehicles left at his home by his friend Steve McQueen (including the car Von Dutch built for McQueen's 1969 film, The Reivers), and working at the pinstriping that sealed his fame as an original American artist. Accompanied by captions that bring to light further facets of this period of Von Dutch's life and career, these photographs illustrate a little-known and largely fascinating chapter of hot rod history. A must for any serious hot rod collection."

If you do not wish to clear Brush FX, we have you covered there too. Simply pallet with 7603/7605/7607 hardener, and you now have a catalyzed, fully UV backed striping and lettering paint that will not fade or fail in the sun or elements. If you want a scientific mixing ratio, mix it 8:1 with our 76 series hardener. Adding hardener, will also help the way it flows, and most find reducer is not needed.<p>\n\nAnother plus with Brush FX is dry times! Literally have a striping paint that is dry in anywhere from 5-10 minutes. You can stripe another color right over it, and it will not move or bleed on you. Try that with the enamels on the market.<p>\nWant coverage on your white? Its called 1 Coat white for a reason. No 2 coats here.

You may wish to pallet the brush with your choice of reducer to gain a consistency you desire. Brush FX gives you full artistic freedom over how to use it, pallet it, and control it.<p>\n\nIf you want to clear over Brush FX, go right ahead. This is the ONLY striping paint on the market that can be cleared without worry of wrinkling or recoat sensitivity issues. No need for tack coats, longer flash times, and hoping and praying as you clear. Finally a worry free striping paint when it comes to clearing! If you do not wish to clear Brush FX, we have you covered there too. Simply pallet with 7603/7605/7607 hardener, and you now have a catalyzed, fully UV backed striping and lettering paint that will not fade or fail in the sun or elements. If you want a scientific mixing ratio, mix it 8:1 with our 76 series hardener. Adding hardener, will also help the way it flows, and most find reducer is not needed.<p>\n\nAnother plus with Brush FX is dry times! Literally have a striping paint that is dry in anywhere from 5-10 minutes. You can stripe another color right over it, and it will not move or bleed on you. Try that with the enamels on the market.<p>\nWant coverage on your white? Its called 1 Coat white for a reason. No 2 coats here. Something Brush FX does offer, is pretty impressive coverage ability.\n<p>\nCurrently available in 19 colors. All colors can be blended together to create your own custom blend as well.</p>"

    "pDescription": "You guessed it: Craig Fraser has been at it again! This time it is not a skull, texture or iconic theme... it is the Artool� Freehand� Airbrush Template �H� StencilTM!<br><br>\n�The �H� StencilTM is a simple French-curve design that can help any artist improve their Artool� Freehand� Shield skills when airbrushing fire, smoke, dragon scales and any number of effects your imagination can conjure up. A huge advantage of the �H� StencilTM is its specific one-handed design. By using one hand you can not only manipulate where you place the stencil, you can also change the shape of it by squeezing it together to morph an outlining edge. The outside radius on the three major legs perfectly match each internal radius, which allows the artist to create positive and negative curves such as the �inclusions� inside realistic fire and the negative space needed when rendering wisps of smoke. The gradual long curves also allow you to use the �H� part of your stencil to help shield and airbrush drop shadows on curved graphics and flames - without having to mask them off. Since it is often necessary to airbrush\nin different scales, the Artool� �H� StencilTM is produced in two sizes. Do not let the simplicity of the �H� StencilTM fool you. Remember the quote: �Less is more!� You will be surprised with the complex images you can create and complete with the simplicity of the �H� StencilTM. Good luck and let me know the various uses you find for this mylar beauty � it has become one of my favorite all-time Artool� Stencils. Keep an eye out for my upcoming articles and videos on its use!�<br><br>",

    "pDescription": "The Grumbacher Company was sold several years ago and the new company discontinued many of the quality brush products.  When the two Grumbacher stripers were no longer offered we found the company who had been making these for Grumbacher and began offering the same brush, but with our name on the handle.  Unfortunately that manufacturing company went out of business in mid 2002 and we assume the assets were purchased by a company in India.  We were concerned about quality, distance, exchange rates etc., so we worked with several \"Grumbacher users\" and developed our own version of the old Grumbacher 1010.  We can not offer the 1020 black plastic handle, since we would have to buy too many handles to get a cost effective price.  Stripers who worked with us to develop this new brush also suggested that it be a bit longer.",

Here are a couple of HOT tips: ghosting effects are incredibly kewl when used with pearl finishes, and you can achieve some radically prominent effects when spraying opaque or metallic layers.

He designed these templates to help create his TRUE FIRE� effect. With an art knife, simply cut the tiny connecting tabs on each TRUE FIRE� template to reveal 18 positive/negative shapes and you are ready to go to work.</p><br><p>BONUS!!! Also included is the instructional Artool TRUE FIRE� Template DVD by Mike Lavallee. On this DVD, Mike shares the tips and tricks on how to create your own realistic fiery effects.\n\nMike Lavallee is setting the custom paint world on fire with his TRUE FIRE� effect. Mike has created and perfected the technique for rendering dramatic realistic interpretations of actual fire burning down the surface of motorcycles, automobiles, boats and aircraft.</p>",

We are having great success with this synthetic sable hair which is also used in Von Dago�s Mini Saber and Saber Liner series.  Let�s look at what the artist has to say about this brush.<p>\n\n�Using my favorite synthetic hair in this brush for longevity, it�s only a mere 3/4&#8243; out from the Ferrule. Whether it be on canvas art or vehicles, I like to personally sign my name to look like a stamp, time after time, so the public � and my peers � can easily tell who striped the car they are admiring, whether it be displayed at a car show or parked in a parking lot.<p>\n\nI designed this brush solely for this purpose � for absolute consistency over �n over �n over! Plus, if you strictly use it for what it�s intended for, it should last you at least a couple of years.<p>\n\nNow we all know you can sign a name with any type of brush, but once again � and speaking only for myself � I want absolute no stress and no hassle consistency.<p>\n\nI want people to be able to read my name, not guess at it, you know?� � Von Dago<p>\n\nThis series is a full synthetic filament mixture.<p>"
